//! Registers this frontend's real projection against the shared conformance
//! corpus. Drives every fixture through the exact functions the running
//! surface itself calls — [`command::is_projected`], a real
//! `InvocableRegistry`, and a real `Dispatcher::dispatch` — never a
//! restatement of the fixture data, so a divergence here is a divergence in
//! this surface's actual behavior, not in a test double.
//!
//! Compiled only under `#[cfg(test)]`: the corpus is something a surface's
//! own test target drives against its real projection, not product runtime
//! code.
//!
//! This task's own scope is the surface-set family and the declared-locus-
//! difference mechanism (l2-tui.md §4.3 v1.2.0, l2-surface-conformance.md
//! §4.6, SP-8) — proving `DeclaredExclusion` is load-bearing, not merely
//! documented in prose. The full corpus run (schema + outcome families, the
//! accepted-residual assertion, and finding F-2's repayment) is a separate,
//! later obligation this registration is built to satisfy without rework.
