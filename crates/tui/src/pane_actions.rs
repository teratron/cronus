//! This surface's own actions — pane focus and quitting the session —
//! registered as `ClientLocal` invocables through the same door a core or
//! contributed verb uses.
//!
//! [`PaneAction`] is the single source of truth for what these actions are:
//! [`register`] iterates every variant to build the registry entry, and
//! `app.rs`'s key handler resolves a key press to the same variant before
//! dispatching — so the two can never name a different set. What is
//! deliberately NOT here is which key triggers which action: key bindings
//! are terminal-surface presentation and stay local to `app.rs` (SP-8's
//! do-not-unify record already treats input mechanics as legitimately
//! per-surface); what must not stay local is the action's own declaration.
//!
//! Each handler is a stateless acknowledgment — `Outcome::Value(Empty)`,
//! nothing more. The actual view-state mutation (which panel gains focus,
//! whether the loop should exit) happens in `app.rs`, which already knows
//! which [`PaneAction`] a key resolved to before it ever called dispatch.
//! That is a legitimate, disclosed division for a `ClientLocal` action: per
//! the registry spec, "the same identity may be implemented per surface" —
//! unlike a `Semantic` verb, nothing here delegates to the core. What a real
//! dispatch through the registry proves is that the action is reachable
//! through the one shared door and not through a second, private path: an
//! action that failed to register, or was never attached, resolves to
//! `Dispatched::Unknown` here exactly as a genuinely unbound verb would
//! anywhere else in this crate, and `app.rs` applies no effect in that case.
