//! The event-driven render loop and the view-model it drives.
//!
//! The loop is split into a pure step function ([`App::tick`]) and a thin driver
//! ([`run_with`]) that feeds it terminal events. This keeps the loop's logic
//! testable without a TTY: tests call `tick` directly with scripted events and a
//! stub state source.
//!
//! INV-5 (view-only): [`App`] holds nothing but a [`ViewModel`] snapshot and a
//! view-local quit flag. All durable state lives in the core and is read through
//! the [`SnapshotSource`] seam — the loop never mutates domain state.
//!
//! Command dispatch (`crate::dispatch`) goes through the real, shared
//! `cronus_core::invocable::Dispatcher` — the same one every surface uses —
//! never a local re-implementation. `App` holds the registry and dispatcher
//! directly rather than behind a trait object: there is exactly one dispatch
//! mechanism now, not a swappable one, so the indirection a trait bought
//! before this migration buys nothing here.
