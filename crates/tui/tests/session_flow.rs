//! Black-box integration coverage for the TUI surface (F-32): every existing
//! test in `crates/tui/src/*.rs` drives `App`/`dispatch` over a synthetic or
//! partial registry (an empty one, a hand-built `board.list` fixture, a
//! `test_catalog()`) — none of them combine the *real* production wiring
//! [`app::run`] actually performs: bootstrapping the real core registry
//! (`cronus_core::invocable_bootstrap::bootstrap`), registering this
//! surface's own actions (`pane_actions::register`), and deriving the
//! catalog from the result (`command::build_catalog`), all driven through
//! `App::tick` by a realistic key/command sequence, exactly as a live
//! session would. This file is that missing seam — a second OS process
//! from every other test binary in the workspace, so it can freely
//! isolate state (`CRONUS_PORTABLE_DIR`) without racing anything outside it.
//!
//! Only the crate's public API is used here (no `#[cfg(test)]` internals),
//! the same boundary an external consumer of `cronus_tui` would see.
