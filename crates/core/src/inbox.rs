//! Inter-actor inbox — SQLite-backed send/drain pipeline with GC and bus events.
//!
//! `BusEvent`, the `BusSender` trait, and its stub implementations moved to
//! `cronus-contract` (§4.2); the SQLite-backed pipeline moved to
//! `cronus-store-local` (§4.6). Re-exported here so every existing call site
//! is unaffected.
