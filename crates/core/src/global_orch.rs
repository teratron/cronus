//! Global orchestration — the building-level coordinator (the home workspace
//! manager), above individual offices.
//!
//! One coordinator per building (GO-1). It maintains a read-only aggregate view of
//! all offices fed by their state events (GO-4), routes cross-office messages over
//! the ACP relay bypassing paused/hibernating offices (GO-5), annotates new-
//! component cards with the phase's mandatory cross-cutting concerns (GO-3), and
//! escalates conflicts (GO-6). It never cancels or re-delegates an office's active
//! work (GO-2) — this module exposes no such path.
//!
//! The ACP relay transport and the event-bus subscription are seams; the aggregate,
//! routing decision, phase-concern annotation, and escalation algebra are here.
