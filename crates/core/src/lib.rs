//! Cronus core engine library — the facade and composition root (§4.1, §4.2).
//!
//! Domain logic lives in `cronus-domain` (no I/O); the SQLite-backed default
//! for the user-data plane lives in `cronus-store-local`; the default for
//! the auth/identity planes lives in `cronus-auth-local`. This crate wires
//! them together and re-exports every module under its historical path, so
//! `cronus::memory::MemoryEntry`, `cronus::orchestration::…`, and every other
//! existing call site are unaffected by the split. Frontends (CLI, TUI, app)
//! depend on this crate; it has no presentation dependencies of its own.
