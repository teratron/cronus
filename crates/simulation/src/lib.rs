//! `cronus-simulation` — the realization of `l1-usage-simulation` (USM-1…USM-12)
//! in this project's stack: a **disposable world** every simulated run
//! happens inside, an **as-it-happens transcript** of what the product
//! actually did, a **replay** lane that re-runs a pinned route with no
//! agent, and a **scenario** format whose parser refuses an obligation that
//! cannot fail.
//!
//! Kept on the ports tier (`cronus-contract` only, nothing from the domain
//! tier) for the same reason `cronus-conformance` is: a surface that cannot
//! yet link the domain tier must still be able to register later.
