Exit codes:
  0  success
  1  the command ran but did not succeed (not found, rejected input,
     a quality-gate escalation, ...) — the common \"no\" from a verb
     that otherwise understood the request
  2  usage error — unrecognized command, missing/malformed argument;
     printed by the argument parser before any verb runs
  3  internal error — composition itself failed (not a verb's own
     result)

Diagnostics and --format:
  --format governs the success payload on stdout only. Every error,
  rejection, and usage message is always English prose on stderr,
  regardless of --format — there is no JSON error shape to parse.
