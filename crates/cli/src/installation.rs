//! The installation half of the command surface (§4.1.1): workspace
//! initialization, diagnostics, and developer-office admission — verbs that
//! configure or inspect the product itself rather than act on the user's
//! work.
//!
//! Unlike the semantic half ([`crate::generated`]), this grammar is not
//! generated from the registry — it is declared **once**, right here, and
//! that one declaration has two consumers: [`build_installation_tree`]
//! builds the parser from it before composition even runs, and
//! [`declared_invocables`] feeds the same list into the catalog at
//! composition, so another surface can see these verbs exist and declare
//! that it deliberately does not offer them, instead of looking merely
//! unfinished. A verb declared in a hand-written parser and again as a
//! hand-written descriptor is two statements of one fact — the exact fork
//! this whole command-surface redesign exists to close, one level up from
//! where the semantic half closes it.
//!
//! This is also why an installation verb answers directly, through the
//! functions already proven in [`crate::commands`], rather than through the
//! shared [`cronus_core::invocable::Dispatcher`]: that shared pipeline
//! exists so one handler can serve every surface, and no other surface ever
//! projects the `Installation` locus (only the command line does), so the
//! indirection would buy nothing here. `tui` is the one exception to
//! *which* function it answers through — it launches the sibling terminal
//! frontend's own composition (`cronus_tui::run`) rather than a
//! `crate::commands` handler, since that frontend's own registry/dispatcher
//! pair is what actually runs a session, not this launcher's.
//!
//! All twelve installation groups live here — `init`, `status`, `doctor`,
//! `restore`, `dev`, `workspace`, `backup`, `activation`, `archetype`,
//! `registry`, `ext`, and `tui` — covering four tree shapes: **flat** (a
//! group's one verb's id-tail equals its group name, so it renders as a
//! single top-level command with no nested verb — `tui` is this shape),
//! **nested** (a group command containing verb subcommands), a **named
//! value flag** (`--actor cli`, `--mode login`), which `BinderKind::NamedText`
//! exists to express — `Binder` had no positional-vs-named-value distinction
//! before this module needed one for `workspace create --name/--path`,
//! `backup create --to`, `activation enable --mode`, and `archetype create
//! --from` — and one extra level of **sub-nesting** (`ext skill
//! import|create|status`), signalled the same way `verb_of` already
//! separates a group from its verbs: a dot in the verb tail (`skill.import`)
//! names one sub-group, not a fourth top-level command.
