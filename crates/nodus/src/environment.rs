//! Environment & Evaluation — the `EnvironmentProvider` extension role.
//!
//! Lets a workflow run against a task world that produces a graded outcome: a
//! reproducible reset/step/evaluate lifecycle, a typed [`Reward`], and a
//! frozen-evaluation boundary that keeps grading read-only over a completed
//! run. The built-in [`StubEnvironment`] satisfies the interface with no I/O,
//! matching the [`crate::executor::StubProvider`] / [`crate::executor::DefaultDialogProvider`]
//! convention.
//!
//! # Scope (v1)
//!
//! `run_with_environment` sequences exactly one `open → reset → execute →
//! evaluate → release` cycle per call: the reset [`Observation`] seeds the
//! workflow's `$in`, the whole workflow runs as the graded unit, and `evaluate`
//! scores the completed run. [`EnvironmentProvider::step`] is a complete,
//! independently-testable part of the trait contract, but no nodus syntax
//! exists yet to bind a workflow step to a mid-run environment action, so the
//! automatic combinator does not call it — the same "interface present, host
//! wiring pending" scoping already used for `StorageProvider`/`PolicyProvider`.
//! A host MAY drive `step` directly against its own `EnvironmentProvider` outside
//! the combinator.
