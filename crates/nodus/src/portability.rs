//! / [`effect_class_of`], wired into `Executor::execute_command`, LP-11). Each
//! trait ships with a built-in implementation sufficient for in-process use
//! without I/O, matching the LP-2 pattern established by
//! [`crate::executor::StubProvider`] and [`crate::observability::NoopAuditProvider`].
//!
//! It also defines the LP-8 capability manifest ([`CapabilityManifest`]) and the
