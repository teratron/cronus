//! Execution observability — the `AuditProvider` trait and closed event taxonomy.
//!
//! Every workflow run can be observed by plugging in an [`AuditProvider`]
//! implementation. The built-in [`NoopAuditProvider`] discards all events and
//! satisfies the interface without any I/O, keeping the no-audit path at the
//! cost of a single indirect call per event.
//!
//! # Observer neutrality
//!
//! The presence or absence of an `AuditProvider` must never alter a run's
//! `@out` values, execution branch outcomes, or error codes. All `record_event`
//! calls are write-only; no return value flows back into the executor.
