//! Office archetypes — a domain-scoped prior on staffing, never a roster.
//!
//! An archetype changes what the manager *expects* (a candidate pool, an org
//! shape adopted only if the work grows, a bounded seed, domain norms), never
//! how it *decides*. Two structural properties are load-bearing: the closed
//! four-key schema makes "no authority" (OA-4) unrepresentable rather than
//! merely forbidden, and the candidate pool is read by the deviation recorder,
//! never by the hire gate (OA-3).
