//! LG-10: objective persistence across in-session reduction. Two runtime
//! shapes share one durable-slot principle (§4.4 of `l1-loop-governance`):
//! discrete iterations already reconstruct fresh from plan/status each time
//! (LG-5); a continuous-session loop that compacts *in place* instead
//! re-projects the standing objective + progress cursor into every turn
//! from a durable `ObjectiveSlot`, so mid-session compaction can never drop
//! the north-star. Composes the shipped CC-9 protected-region mechanism
//! (`context_mgmt::trim_cascade`) rather than reinventing eviction.
