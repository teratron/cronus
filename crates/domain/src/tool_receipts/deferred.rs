//! Deferred-action lifecycle (TR-8): an action detached from the current
//! turn (`l1-execution-graph.md` EG-12) cannot be receipted at dispatch,
//! because its result — the thing TR-3 requires inside the MAC — does not
//! exist yet. `Pending` is a distinct state, never a receipt over a
//! placeholder result: a tag computed over a fabricated result would be a
//! *valid* receipt for a false claim, which inverts the entire subsystem.
