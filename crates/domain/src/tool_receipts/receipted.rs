//! `Receipted<T>` — an outcome that cannot exist without a receipt (TR-1).
//! There is no public constructor and no `From<T>`: the only way to obtain
//! one is [`mint_receipted`], which requires the caller to already hold a
//! [`ReceiptKey`] and a filled [`ActionBinding`] carrying the real observed
//! outcome. The value and its proof are produced together in one step, so
//! a caller can never hold the value without the receipt travelling
//! beside it.
