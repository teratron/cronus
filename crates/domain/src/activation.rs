//! Activation policy — the domain-tier transition state machine over the
//! `ActivationRegistry` seam (l2-service-activation §4.4/§4.6, BA-3/BA-5/
//! BA-6/BA-7). The seam's `enable`/`disable` are adapter-level primitives
//! (register exactly this mode / remove whatever is registered); this module
//! owns the *policy* — the mutual-exclusion ordering, the read-back
//! verification that makes a failure converge on `Inactive` rather than a
//! doubly-registered or silently-wrong state, and per-mode consent
//! bookkeeping. The adapter never decides any of this; it only executes the
//! OS calls this module directs it to.
