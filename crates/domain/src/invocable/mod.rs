//! The invocable registry and its dispatch: one registration door for every
//! action the core and its extensions expose, and the bind-before-invoke
//! rule that runs them.
//!
//! Pure and I/O-free — registration, binding, and lookup are in-memory
//! bookkeeping with no adapter behind them. The facade calls the same
//! [`InvocableRegistry::register`] for core invocables that an extension
//! loader calls for contributed ones; there is no second, privileged path.
//!
//! Two concerns, two files: the catalog ([`registry`]) and its identity
//! rules, and execution ([`dispatch`]) and its binding rule.
