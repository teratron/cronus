//! The execution half: bind an invocation's arguments against its
//! invocable's declared binders, and only then run the attached handler —
//! under containment when the handler belongs to a contribution (EP-6).
//!
//! Binding and execution are deliberately two separate steps with a hard
//! ordering (IB-2): every declared binder is checked before the handler
//! runs at all, so a rejection is a structural fact ("the handler did not
//! run") rather than something the handler itself would have to notice and
//! report. This module's own [`bind`] can produce only two of the four
//! rejection modes — [`RejectionMode::Absent`] (nothing supplied for a
//! required binder) and [`RejectionMode::IllShaped`] (a supplied value's
//! shape does not match the binder's declared kind) — because the values it
//! checks ([`ArgValue`]) are already fully parsed, typed, in-memory data.
//! [`RejectionMode::Unreadable`] (a source could not be obtained) and
//! [`RejectionMode::Malformed`] (present but not parseable at all) describe
//! failures that happen *before* a value becomes an [`ArgValue`] — reading
//! an external source, parsing raw surface input — and that is I/O and
//! surface-specific work this crate's no-I/O tier must not perform (§4.3);
//! it belongs to whatever surface constructs an [`ArgValues`] from raw
//! input, upstream of dispatch. Both modes remain fully representable and
//! located by [`Rejection`] itself; this module just is not where they
//! originate.
//!
//! A core invocable's handler runs directly — it is the trusted kernel, and
//! a core panic is a real defect that must propagate, not a contained
//! failure papered over. A contribution's handler runs on a bounded,
//! panic-caught path: Rust cannot safely preempt a running thread, so the
//! bound is enforced by handing the call to a fresh, unscoped thread and
//! giving up on waiting for it past the bound — the orphaned thread runs to
//! completion on its own and its (now-unwanted) result is discarded, but
//! the caller is never held past the bound, and no dispatch call ever
//! blocks indefinitely or ends in an unstructured panic.
