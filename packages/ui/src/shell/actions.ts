/**
 * The action registry — the command vocabulary (AS-6).
 *
 * A `ShellAction` is a named command independent of how it is triggered (a menu
 * leaf, a keybinding, a palette row, or code). A control invokes an action by id
 * and never holds the behaviour, so the same action is renderable in a menu, the
 * palette, and the keymap surface without bespoke wiring. Two gates decide
 * whether a surface may show an action: `bound` (is the capability shipped —
 * INV-9) and `when` (is it live in the current context — AS-7).
 *
 * This module is still narrow: it carries the vocabulary and the two gates. The
 * keystroke resolution that consumes `when` lives in `../shared/keymap`. The one
 * IPC-adjacent piece it does carry is {@link actionsFromCatalog} — deriving
 * `Semantic` actions from the core's own catalog is what keeps this registry
 * from becoming a second, hand-maintained copy of it (AS-6, §4.4).

 * for a `Semantic` action sourced from the core's own catalog, whose `name`

 * dropped — it simply produces no `ShellAction` at all, so a stale caller
 * holding an old id sees it vanish from `bound()`/`live()` the moment the
 * catalog snapshot that built this list moves on (the catalog cache's own
 * refresh is what keeps that snapshot current).
 *
 * `ClientLocal` (and every other locus) stays out: those actions have no
 * generic dispatch path this function could wire, and a surface declares
 * them locally instead — the terminal UI's own precedent for the same
 * locus split, applied here to the action registry rather than a slash
 * catalog.
 *
 * `dispatch` is the one seam this function needs — a plain `(id) => void`,
 * not a `CoreClient` — so this module stays free of any IPC dependency
 * (its own module doc: "carries the vocabulary and the two gates," nothing
 * else). A descriptor declaring required arguments (`binders`) still
 * becomes an action that dispatches with none: no surface in this codebase
 * collects arguments for a menu/palette click yet, a disclosed limitation
 * rather than a reason to leave such descriptors out of the catalog-derived
 * set entirely.
