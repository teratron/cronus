/**
 * Wire a core push channel to a projection store (AS-3): opening the channel
 * puts the store in `pending`, a message fulfils it, and a close — whether the
 * channel failed to open or the host reported it closed — makes it *unavailable*
 * with the reason, never leaving a stale value on screen as if current.
 *
 * There is no retry here. Reconnection is the caller re-invoking this, which
 * re-requests: a fresh `pending`, then the next `fulfill`. A gap of unknown
 * length is not reconciled by the next delta, so a mid-stream resume is wrong by
 * construction.
