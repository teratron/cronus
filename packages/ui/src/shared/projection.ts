/**
 * A projection — the frontend's cache of one core-owned fact, plus the honest
 * status of the request that produced it (spec §4.2).
 *
 * A projection store never invents a value. Its snapshot is exactly one of four
 * states, and "loaded but empty" is not the same state as "could not ask": the
 * distinction between *no offices* and *the core did not answer* is preserved all
 * the way to the render, because collapsing it is how a shell starts showing
 * fabricated data (INV-9). There is deliberately no default-empty state.
 *
 * This module is the type and the store factory. Nothing fetches here — a core
 * event, delivered over the bridge subscription, drives `request` / `fulfill` /
 * `fail`; that wiring lives with the seam, not here.
