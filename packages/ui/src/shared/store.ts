/**
 * The reactive substrate — a hand-rolled subscribable store, no state library.
 *
 * The application shell holds no domain state (INV-2): every store built here
 * caches a projection of core state, or the frame's own view state. What that
 * needs is a subscribable value with a single mutation path — not the selectors,
 * middleware, and devtools a state-management dependency brings. A dependency
 * whose main value is managing complex client state is also an invitation to
 * grow some, which this package must not.
 *
 * `createStore` is the single authority for one domain (AS-1): `dispatch` is the
 * only way its state changes, `subscribe` hands back the deregister function
 * (AS-4), and `snapshot` is referentially stable while the state is unchanged so
 * a `useSyncExternalStore` reader never re-renders on identity churn.
 *
 * `useStore` is the scoped subscription (AS-3): a component re-renders only when
 * the slice its selector returns actually changes, compared with `Object.is` by
 * default or a caller-supplied equality.
