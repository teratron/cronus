/**
 * The local cache of `capability_catalog`'s own answer — one `Invocable[]`
 * projection (§4.2's shape, applied to the invocable catalog) plus the
 * refresh that repopulates it.
 *
 * This surface's own catalog copy can go stale between an extension
 * activating/deactivating in the core and the next delivery. Dispatching an
 * id the local copy no longer recognises resolves to the registry's real
 * `Unknown` answer (`null`, SP-13) — never a fabricated failure — and the
 * correct response here is to refresh the cache, not render an error. The
 * registry's own change-announcement mechanism (l2-invocable-registry.md
 * §4.9) is the primary refresh trigger in production; `Unknown` is the
 * backstop for the delivery window between a change and its announcement,
 * not the only path — this module only builds the backstop.
