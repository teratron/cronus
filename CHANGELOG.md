## [nodus-0.2.0] — 2026-06-24

### Added (crates/nodus)

- **Observability framework** (`observability.rs`): `AuditProvider` trait (7-method lifecycle), `ExecutionEvent` 10-variant enum (step_start/step_end/step_error/constraint_hit/branch_taken/loop_iteration/macro_enter/macro_exit/model_call/model_response), `NoopAuditProvider`, `RunManifest`, `FieldDescriptor`; executor hook-points wired for all 10 events; HO-1…HO-6 compliant
- **Observability public API**: `run_with_audit()`, `run_with_provider_and_audit()` — composable with `ModelProvider`
- **Portability framework** (`portability.rs`): `SchemaProvider` trait + `BuiltinSchemaProvider`; `StorageProvider` + `NoopStorageProvider`; `PolicyProvider` + `NoopPolicyProvider`; LP-1…LP-7 compliant
- **Portability public API**: `run_with_schema()`, `run_with_schema_and_audit()`; `Schema::with_provider()`, `is_host_command()`; schema-aware lexer (`new_with_schema`) and parser (`parse_with_schema`)
- **Testing framework** (`workflows.rs`): `evaluate_test_block()` assertion evaluator; `test_with_tags()` with `TestOptions { tags }`; NT-1 block isolation, NT-2 input override, NT-3–NT-4 assertion pass/fail, NT-5 provider neutrality, NT-6 tag filtering, NT-7 ordered reporting
- **Validator diagnostics**: W001 (route with no covering `@test:` block), W002 (`@test:` block with no `expected:` entries), E015 (duplicate test name in same file)
- **Testing spec**: `l2-nodus-testing.md` v1.0.0 (Stable) — NT-1…NT-10 compliance table, `TestBlock` AST documentation, `TestReport`/`TestResult` types, diagnostic codes

### Changed (crates/nodus)

- `TestBlock` AST node: `input: Vec<(String, String)>`, `expected: Vec<(String, String)>`, `tags: Vec<String>` typed fields added alongside `raw_lines` backward-compat companion
- `parse_test_block()`: now populates typed fields from `input:`/`expected:`/`tags:` key-value lines
- `test()` function: replaced stub pass-on-Ok with full per-block assertion evaluation
- `l2-nodus-runtime.md` bumped v1.0.2 → v1.0.3 (observability) → v1.0.4 (portability)
- Test count: 126 (Phase 0) → 142 (Phase 2) → 143 (Phase 3) → 163 (Phase 4) → 166 (Phase 5) → **204 (Phase 6)**
- All 8 nodus workspace specs promoted to `Stable`
