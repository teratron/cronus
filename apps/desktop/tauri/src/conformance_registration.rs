//! library, not one central suite, finally proven rather than only
//! asserted).
//!
//! Drives every fixture through the exact seam the real shell crosses:
//! [`Bridge::catalog`]/[`Bridge::invoke`] — never a raw `InvocableRegistry`
//! or `Dispatcher` read directly, which this crate does not otherwise touch
//! at all outside this test-only registration. A divergence here is a
//! divergence in this shell's real bridge, not in a test double standing in
//! for it.
//!
//! Compiled only under `#[cfg(test)]`: the corpus is something a surface's
//! own test target drives against its real projection, not product runtime
//! code.
