# Nodus Human-in-the-Loop Dialog Implementation (Rust)

**Version:** 1.2.1
**Status:** Stable
**Layer:** implementation
**Implements:** l1-nodus-dialog.md

## Overview

Concrete Rust realization of the dialog contract. Maps each `DG`-invariant from
`l1-nodus-dialog.md` to its enforcing mechanism in `crates/nodus`: the `ASK` and
`CONFIRM` commands and their modifiers, the `Status::Paused` run state and its
resume descriptor, the `DialogProvider` extension point with a built-in
synchronous resolver, the `ExtensionRole::Dialog` capability-manifest binding,
and the executor wiring that makes a dialog step block-then-resolve. The dialog
error codes (`DIALOG_TIMEOUT` / `DIALOG_REJECTED` / `PAUSED`) already exist in
the runtime taxonomy; this spec specifies their emission.

## Related Specifications

- [l1-nodus-dialog.md](l1-nodus-dialog.md) — the dialog contract this implements (DG-1…DG-11)
- [l2-nodus-runtime.md](l2-nodus-runtime.md) — runtime crate extended here: `vocab` (commands, `Status`), `executor`, the `run_with_*` family
- [l2-nodus-portability.md](l2-nodus-portability.md) — LP-2 extension-point pattern + the LP-8 `ExtensionRole` taxonomy this adds `Dialog` to; [ADDED v1.2.0] §4.10's LP-16 `+reversible`/`+external` declaration surface is what makes §4.8's placement advisory decidable
- [l2-nodus-errors.md](l2-nodus-errors.md) — owns the `DIALOG_TIMEOUT`/`DIALOG_REJECTED`/`PAUSED` codes and their severity/category
- [l2-nodus-observability.md](l2-nodus-observability.md) — [ADDED v1.1.0] owns `EventAnnotations`, the HO-9/11/16/17 carrier §4.7 extends with a fifth field for DG-9's provenance signal

## 1. Motivation

`l1-nodus-dialog.md` defines a host-neutral dialog contract, but the crate has no
`ASK`/`CONFIRM` commands, no `Paused` run state, and no dialog extension point.
This spec records the minimal additions that realize the contract while keeping
the executor's run-to-completion model intact for the common (default-resolved)
case: a dialog backend trait following the established `ModelProvider`/
`AuditProvider` pattern, a built-in synchronous resolver, and a `Paused` signal
for the case a host must handle out-of-band.

## 2. Constraints & Assumptions

- No new external dependency (LP-1): the dialog backend is an in-tree trait with a built-in no-I/O resolver.
- `ASK`/`CONFIRM` are added to the schema vocabulary; existing `KNOWN_COMMANDS` and reserved variables are not mutated (LP-4 — additions only).
- The built-in resolver is synchronous and never blocks: it resolves a dialog from `+default` or signals `Status::Paused` (DG-2/DG-6).
- True cross-invocation suspend/resume is a host concern over the `Status::Paused` signal; the executor does not serialise or restore mid-run state itself.
- Raw human answers bound to variables are user data; the dialog audit events carry only typed/length descriptors, never the raw text (DG-7, reusing the observability `FieldDescriptor`).

## 3. Invariant Compliance

| DG Invariant | Rust Enforcement |
| --- | --- |
| DG-1 Host neutrality | The backend is a `DialogProvider` trait; the executor never names a UI. Built-in `DefaultDialogProvider` ships; interactive backends live outside the crate (LP-2). |
| DG-2 Blocking progression | The executor resolves a dialog step before advancing: it calls the provider, and on no resolution returns `Status::Paused` without running later steps. |
| DG-3 Typed binding | `ASK` coerces the answer to its `+type` (str/bool/confirm/choice/multi_choice) into a `Value`, then binds it to the pipeline target; a `+validate` failure re-prompts or routes per the validator. |
| DG-4 Suspend/resume | An unresolved blocking dialog and `!PAUSE` set `Status::Paused` and produce a `ResumeDescriptor` (workflow id + var snapshot + step index); re-invocation with the answer continues deterministically. |
| DG-5 Typed failures | `+timeout` → `NODUS:DIALOG_TIMEOUT`; `+strict` `CONFIRM` rejection → `NODUS:DIALOG_REJECTED`; both are `RuntimeError`s routed to `@err:`. |
| DG-6 Default-on-absence | `DefaultDialogProvider` resolves a dialog with a `+default` and otherwise signals pause; it never blocks (a non-interactive run completes or pauses, never hangs). |
| DG-7 Trace data-safety | Dialog events reuse `observability::FieldDescriptor` (type + length), never raw answer text. |
| DG-8 Capability declaration | `ExtensionRole::Dialog` is added to the manifest taxonomy; `CapabilityManifest::from_workflow` requires it for any `ASK`/`CONFIRM` whose step lacks a `+default`, so a host with no dialog backend is rejected fail-fast. |
| DG-9 Memoizable approval [ADDED v1.1.0] | **Implemented [v1.1.1] — Phase 28.** `+remember` needs no new grammar (§2's existing `+modifier` pass-through already carries it to `DialogProvider::ask`/`confirm`, unread by nodus, exactly like every other undeclared modifier). Nodus's own obligation — a distinct trace provenance on a memoized resolution — realizes as a new `DialogOutcome::Remembered(Value)` variant (§4.7), bound identically to `Answer` but tagged `DialogProvenance::Remembered` on the step's `StepEnd` annotations, vs. `Answered` for the ordinary path. The host's own `ask`/`confirm` implementation performs the entire recall / governance / fit-check pseudocode of L1 §4.6 internally (it already receives the raw `+remember` modifier and returns whichever outcome applies) — no new `DialogProvider` trait method needed. 467 tests pass (was 462, +5). |
| DG-10 Promotable remembered decision [ADDED v1.1.0] | **Realized for free by DG-9 — no separate mechanism [confirmed, Phase 28].** L1 §4.7's `recurrence`/`consider_promotion` pseudocode is entirely host-side: a host's `DialogProvider` already owns the durable store behind DG-9 (it is the one that decided to return `Remembered`), so it already knows a dialog identity's occasion count without nodus reporting anything further. DG-9's per-event `DialogProvenance::Remembered` tag *is* the recurrence signal DG-10 builds on — the same "rides an existing signal, no enumerated list" shape this session's NL-9 `@err:` dispatch and LP-17 `SETTLEMENT_UNACCOUNTED` also use. No code exists for DG-10 specifically, by design — nothing to implement. |
| DG-11 Latest-reversible placement & decision-ready payload [ADDED v1.2.0] | **Advisory — specified in §4.8.** The first dialog invariant that constrains *authoring* rather than runtime behaviour, and its L1 says so: both properties are ones a validator MAY advise on, and neither touches the `Paused`/resume contract (DG-4) or memoization (DG-9). Realized as two `Severity::Warning` validator advisories over data the validator already collects — `W016` for a dialog placed earlier than its own dependencies require, `W017` for a prompt that inlines a produced artifact instead of referring to it. Neither blocks a run; the brief-quality half of the payload rule is declared out of core scope (§4.8.3), because judging prose is a model act and this crate is model-free. |

## 4. Detailed Design

### 4.1 Vocabulary & Status additions

```text
[REFERENCE]
// vocab.rs — added to KNOWN_COMMANDS
"ASK", "CONFIRM"

// executor.rs — Status gains a variant (l2-nodus-runtime §4.7(h))
pub enum Status { Ok, Partial, Failed, Aborted, Paused }
```

`ASK`/`CONFIRM` modifiers (`+type`, `+options`, `+hint`, `+default`, `+validate`,
`+timeout`, `+strict`, `+actions`) reuse the existing `CommandCall.modifiers`
vector — no grammar change beyond recognising the two command names.

### 4.2 DialogProvider extension point

```text
[REFERENCE]
pub enum DialogOutcome {
    Answer(Value),   // resolved (by human or +default)
    Pause,           // no resolution available; caller should suspend
    Timeout,         // +timeout elapsed → DIALOG_TIMEOUT
    Rejected,        // +strict CONFIRM rejected → DIALOG_REJECTED
}

pub trait DialogProvider {
    fn ask(&self, prompt: &str, modifiers: &[(String, String)]) -> DialogOutcome;
    fn confirm(&self, content: &str, modifiers: &[(String, String)]) -> DialogOutcome;
}

/// Built-in synchronous resolver: returns the `+default` as an `Answer`,
/// otherwise `Pause`. Never performs I/O, never blocks (DG-6).
pub struct DefaultDialogProvider;
```

`DefaultDialogProvider` mirrors `StubProvider`/`NoopAuditProvider`: it satisfies
the interface with no I/O and is the provider the plain `run`/`run_with_*` paths
use.

### 4.3 Resume descriptor

```text
[REFERENCE]
pub struct ResumeDescriptor {
    pub workflow: String,                 // "wf:<name>"
    pub vars: HashMap<String, Value>,     // environment snapshot at suspension
    pub step_index: u32,                  // suspended step
}
```

`RunResult` carries `Option<ResumeDescriptor>`, populated only when
`status == Paused`. The runtime defines the descriptor; the host persists and
re-supplies it (LP-1). The descriptor never includes raw prompt text (DG-7).

### 4.4 Executor wiring

The executor gains a `DialogProvider` alongside its `ModelProvider`/
`AuditProvider`. `execute_command` dispatches `ASK`/`CONFIRM` to the provider:

- `Answer(v)` → bind `v` to the pipeline target (DG-3) and continue.
- `Pause` → stop the step loop, set `Status::Paused`, emit `NODUS:PAUSED` (info), and build the `ResumeDescriptor` (DG-2/DG-4).
- `Timeout` / `Rejected` → push the matching `RuntimeError`, route to `@err:` (DG-5).

`!HALT` sets `Status::Failed`; `!PAUSE` sets `Status::Paused` with a descriptor.
Dialog events (`ModelCall`-style, but dialog-tagged) carry `FieldDescriptor`
summaries only (DG-7).

### 4.5 Manifest integration

```text
[REFERENCE]
// portability.rs — ExtensionRole gains a variant
pub enum ExtensionRole { Model, Audit, Storage, Policy, Vocabulary, Dialog }
```

`CapabilityManifest::from_workflow` adds `Dialog` when it encounters an
`ASK`/`CONFIRM` whose step declares no `+default`; `HostCapabilities::builtin()`
does **not** provide `Dialog` (the default resolver only handles `+default`
dialogs), so a workflow needing real interaction is rejected fail-fast against a
non-interactive host (DG-8).

### 4.6 Public API

```text
[REFERENCE]
pub fn run_with_dialog(
    source, filename, input, dialog: &dyn DialogProvider,
) -> Result<RunResult, Vec<Diagnostic>>;

pub fn run_with_dialog_and_audit(
    source, filename, input, dialog, audit, run_id, started_at,
) -> Result<RunResult, Vec<Diagnostic>>;
```

Consistent with the orthogonal `run_with_*` combinator family (LP-5).

### 4.7 Memoizable & promotable approval (DG-9/DG-10) [ADDED v1.1.0]

```text
[REFERENCE]
pub enum DialogOutcome {
    Answer(Value),      // resolved fresh (by human or +default)
    Remembered(Value),  // resolved from a host durable prior decision (DG-9)
    Pause,
    Timeout,
    Rejected,
}

// observability.rs — EventAnnotations gains a fifth optional field,
// alongside message/anomaly/receipt/durability (HO-11/16/9/17); None for
// every non-dialog event and for a dialog step's non-resolution outcomes
// (Pause/Timeout/Rejected carry no provenance — they are not a decision).
pub enum DialogProvenance { Answered, Remembered }
pub struct EventAnnotations {
    // ...existing fields unchanged...
    pub dialog_provenance: Option<DialogProvenance>,
}
```

`handle_dialog` binds `Remembered(v)` through the exact same path as `Answer(v)`
(`ctx.set_var`, `ctx.log_step`) — memoization changes *where* the value came from,
never *how* it is bound, which is what keeps DG-9's "never turns a rejection into
an approval, never relaxes `+strict`, never binds a value failing `+type`/
`+validate`" discipline true by construction: a `Remembered` value flows through
the identical typed-binding path an `Answer` does, so it is subject to the same
`+type`/`+validate` handling, not a bypass. The only difference reaching the trace
is the `StepEnd` event's `annotations.dialog_provenance` — `Some(Answered)` on
`Answer`, `Some(Remembered)` on `Remembered`, `None` on `Pause`/`Timeout`/
`Rejected` (they resolve nothing to have a provenance).

**[CONFIRMED Phase 28]** `dialog_provenance` is the first `EventAnnotations` field the
crate's *own* dispatch logic populates directly, rather than a host annotating the stream
after the fact — every other field (`message`/`anomaly`/`receipt`/`durability`) has no
current writer inside the crate at all. `EventAnnotations`'s own doc comment (`observability.rs`)
was updated to say so explicitly, since only `handle_dialog` — not an external observer —
knows which `DialogOutcome` variant resolved a step. This does not change HO-6's closed
event-taxonomy discipline (no new `ExecutionEvent` variant, one field on the existing
carrier) — it only means "host-supplied" no longer describes every field on that carrier.

The host's `ask`/`confirm` implementation is where all of DG-9's real logic lives:
recall the durable prior decision keyed by the resolved prompt/action signature,
check governance permits reusing it, confirm the remembered value still fits the
step's `+type`/`+validate`, and return `Remembered` — or fall through to an
ordinary prompt and return `Answer` (fail-safe to asking, per DG-9's own
discipline). None of that needs a new `DialogProvider` method: `ask`/`confirm`
already receive the full raw `modifiers` slice, so a host checks for `+remember`
itself exactly as it would check for any other modifier it cares about.

**LP-6 note**: adding a `DialogOutcome` variant is a breaking change for any host
matching the enum exhaustively without a wildcard arm — acceptable pre-1.0 (the
`NoopStorageProvider` → `InMemoryStorageProvider` rename precedent), and the only
realistic shape for a closed 5-variant outcome taxonomy that must distinguish
*why* a dialog resolved without inventing a second orthogonal signal.

### 4.8 Latest-reversible placement & decision-ready payload (DG-11) [ADDED v1.2.0]

DG-11 differs in kind from DG-1…DG-10: it constrains how an author *positions and
composes* a dialog, not what the runtime does when one executes. Its L1 text settles the
realization question directly — both properties are ones "a validator MAY advise on", and
neither alters the `Paused`/resume contract (DG-4) or the memoization semantics (DG-9). So
this section specifies **validator advisories**: never errors, never runtime checks, and
never an automatic reordering of the author's steps. A run that ignores both advisories is
a conforming run.

#### 4.8.1 Why the validator can decide this at all

The placement rule needs three facts about a step, and the crate already produces all
three — this is why DG-11 is realizable now rather than after some future mechanism.

1. **Is this step a dialog?** `DIALOG_COMMANDS` (`portability.rs`) is the closed set
   `["ASK", "CONFIRM"]` — the same set `EffectClass::Deferred` already classifies on.
2. **Is a following step safe to run before the question?** LP-16's declaration surface
   (`l2-nodus-portability.md` §4.10) carries `+reversible` and `+external` as ordinary
   `CommandCall.modifiers`, parsed today with no new grammar. A step declaring
   `+external=true` or `+reversible=false` is exactly the boundary DG-11 says a dialog
   must never move past.
3. **Does a following step depend on the answer?** `collect_vars_stmt` already walks every
   statement's variable reads and writes for `E004`/`E014`. The dialog's pipeline target
   (`→ $answer`) is a write; the first later step that reads it closes the movable window,
   which is DG-11's second bound — deferring a question past the work it gates does not
   defer it, it answers it by assumption.

No new AST node, no new grammar, no new provider call, and no runtime data: the advisory is
computable at validation time, which NL-4 requires it to be.

#### 4.8.2 `W016` — dialog asked earlier than its own dependencies require

Emitted at `Severity::Warning` on a dialog step `D` when **all** of the following hold:

```plaintext
(a) D.command ∈ DIALOG_COMMANDS
(b) ∃ S after D in the same block, where
       S.command ∉ DIALOG_COMMANDS
       S declares +reversible=true
       S does not declare +external=true
(c) no step in (D, S] reads D's pipeline target variable
```

The message names the **last** such `S` — the step `D` could be moved past — and states the
reason in the author's terms: the human is being asked before work the run would have
settled on its own. `W016` never blocks a run.

**Condition (b) requires a positive declaration, and that is the design decision of this
section.** The alternative — firing on any following step that has *not* declared itself
irreversible — would give far higher recall and would be wrong in exactly the case DG-11
treats as the hard bound. LP-16's descriptors are *omitted, never defaulted* (§4.10.2 of
`l2-nodus-portability.md`): an absent `+reversible` means **not declared**, not "reversible".
An advisory that can recommend moving a confirmation past an irreversible effect is worse
than one that stays quiet, so recall is deliberately traded for soundness. The consequence is
a proportionate one: `W016`'s reach grows with LP-16 adoption, and declaring risk classes buys
placement advice — the two invariants compose rather than merely coexist.

The fixed-control-point case DG-11 explicitly excludes needs no special handling: a dialog
whose position is *not* the author's choice is one whose following step reads its answer, and
condition (c) already excludes it.

Two boundary cases the predicate must not leave to the reader. **A dialog with no pipeline
target** — a bare `CONFIRM` used as a gate, whose only effects are the pause and the
`+strict` rejection path — has an empty dependency set, so condition (c) holds for every
following step and placement is bounded by (b) alone. That is the intended reading: a gate
with no binding constrains nothing downstream, so it is the case where late placement helps
most, not a case to exempt. **The two clauses of (b) are not redundant**: a step may declare
`+reversible=true` *and* `+external=true` — an outward effect that can afterwards be
retracted, such as a message that can be recalled — and DG-11 bounds placement at
irreversible **or** outward, so an outward step stops the dialog moving past it even when it
is reversible.

#### 4.8.3 Payload — the checkable half, and the half that is not core's

DG-11's payload rule has two parts, and honesty about which one a validator can hold is the
substance here.

**Not core-checkable, declared so explicitly.** Whether a prompt is a *decision-ready brief*
— naming what the run produced, what the decision turns on, and what is being asked — is a
judgement about prose. A validator that scored prose would be a model, and this crate is
model-free by LP-1 with a deterministic `StubProvider` built-in. Recording this as out of
scope is preferable to leaving it implicitly unimplemented: the obligation stays with the
author, where DG-11 put it.

**Checkable: the reference-not-inlined half — realized against the whole-argument reference
model nodus actually has, not an interpolation scanner [CORRECTED at implementation].**
`W017`, `Severity::Warning`, fires when an `ASK`/`CONFIRM` argument is a bare `$var` —
nodus has no string-interpolation scanner; every variable reference the validator recognizes
elsewhere (`collect_vars_stmt`'s own `arg.starts_with('$')` test) is a whole positional
argument token, and this is the same model — whose root was written by a command in
`MODEL_COMMANDS` (`GEN` / `ANALYZE`) anywhere in the file: the dialog is inlining a produced
artifact into the prompt rather than referring to it, which is precisely what DG-11 says a
brief must not do. The producer is established by a **dedicated single-pass walker**
(`w017_collect_producers`), not the `collect_vars_stmt` walk §4.8.1 relies on for `W016`:
that function tracks *declared*/*used* variable-root sets for `E004`/`E014` and has no notion
of *which* command produced a target, so a purpose-built pass records `target-root →
producing command name` instead — no value is inspected either way, and the check remains a
pure validation-time property (NL-4). The message names the variable and the producing
**command** (e.g. "an earlier `GEN` step"), not a step number — `wf.steps` order is
irrelevant to this check, since a variable used before its producer is already a separate
`E014` finding.

Deliberately **not** a size heuristic: a length threshold would need the value, which the
validator cannot have (validation precedes execution, NL-4), and measuring the source text
instead measures the wrong thing — a short interpolation of a large artifact is the case
DG-11 is about.

**Code allocation.** `W001`…`W015` are in use in `validator.rs`; `W016` and `W017` occur
nowhere in the crate and are free.

#### 4.8.4 What this section does not settle

- **No runtime enforcement of either property.** DG-4's `Paused`/resume contract and DG-9's
  memoization are untouched, exactly as the L1 requires; nothing here changes what a run does.
- **`W016` sees one block at a time — precisely the sequence-bearing containers, not every
  block-shaped construct [CORRECTED at implementation].** A dialog inside `?IF`/`?ELIF`/
  `?ELSE` or `~FOR`/`~UNTIL` is scoped to its own body, and movement across that boundary is
  deliberately not advised: moving a dialog out of a conditional changes *whether* it is
  asked, not only when — a different decision from the one DG-11 governs, and not one a
  validator should nudge. `~PARALLEL` branches are walked for scopes nested further inside
  them but are never paired against each other: branches run **concurrently**, so there is no
  "runs before it" relation between siblings for (b) to test. `?SWITCH` arms/default and
  `~MAP`'s command are a single `CommandCall`, not a sequence — a dialog can appear only as a
  whole arm's or map's action, which by construction has no following sibling to advise
  moving past, so it can never contribute a `W016` finding regardless of block type.
- **`W016`'s recall is bounded by LP-16 adoption, on purpose** (§4.8.2).
- **The brief's quality stays with the author** (§4.8.3), and no future core mechanism is
  implied by leaving it there.

## 5. Drawbacks & Alternatives

- **Mid-run coroutine suspension** (capture/restore the executor stack): rejected — it rewrites the run-to-completion model for every workflow to serve a minority of dialog steps. The `Status::Paused` + resume-descriptor signal achieves durable hand-off without that cost.
- **Folding dialog into `ModelProvider`**: rejected — conflates inference with human interaction; violates LP-5 (a host needing only one would be forced to supply both).
- **Blocking built-in resolver** (read stdin): rejected — it makes tests and headless runs hang; the default-or-pause resolver keeps non-interactive runs deterministic (DG-6).
- **New `DialogProvider::recall`/`may_memoize` trait methods** (DG-9): rejected — `ask`/`confirm` already receive the full `modifiers` slice, so a host can implement recall/governance entirely inside its own method body; a second trait method would duplicate a capability the existing signature already grants, the same reasoning `l2-nodus-settlement.md` §6 used to keep `SettlementRail::settle` on raw args rather than a typed wrapper.
- **A separate `DialogResolved` event instead of an `EventAnnotations` field** (DG-9): rejected — HO-6's closed event taxonomy is extended via optional fields on existing events (the HO-8/9/10/11/13/16/17 precedent), not new variants; dialog already reuses `StepStart`/`ModelCall`/`StepEnd` rather than minting dialog-specific events (DG-7), and provenance is no exception.
- **A nodus-side recurrence counter for DG-10**: rejected — the host's own durable store already knows a dialog identity's occasion count (it decided to return `Remembered`), so nodus tracking a parallel count would be redundant state that could drift from the host's own; DG-10 is fully discharged by DG-9's per-event provenance tag.

## 6. Implementation Notes

- Order: vocabulary + `Status::Paused` first (smallest, unblocks everything), then `DialogProvider` + `DefaultDialogProvider`, then executor dispatch, then manifest `Dialog` role, then the `run_with_dialog` combinators.
- `ExtensionRole::Dialog` is additive to the LP-8 enum; the `error_meta` registry and `validate_manifest` resolver already handle new roles generically.
- The dialog error codes are already canonical (`l2-nodus-errors.md`); this phase only adds their emission sites.
- **[ADDED v1.1.0]** DG-9/DG-10 add no new command, no new modifier registry entry (modifiers are already unconstrained free-form pass-through — confirmed no `KNOWN_MODIFIERS` registry exists, the same finding `l2-nodus-portability.md` §4.10 made for LP-16), and no new `DialogProvider` trait method — the smallest realization in this spec besides the original vocabulary addition: one `DialogOutcome` variant, one `EventAnnotations` field, one `handle_dialog` match arm sharing `Answer`'s binding logic.

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1.1.1 | 2026-08-01 | Core Team | **Implemented the DG-9/DG-10 seam designed in v1.1.0 — Phase 28.** `DialogOutcome::Remembered(Value)` + `DialogProvenance{Answered,Remembered}` (`observability.rs`, beside `EventAnnotations`) + the `dialog_provenance` field landed exactly as designed; `handle_dialog`'s single `outcome` match now also computes the provenance for the one `StepEnd` emit, no second emit call. **Confirmed rather than assumed**: `dialog_provenance` is the first `EventAnnotations` field the crate's own dispatch logic populates directly (every sibling field has no in-crate writer at all) — `EventAnnotations`'s own doc comment updated to say so; recorded in §4.7 rather than silently adjusted. DG-10 needed zero code, confirming the v1.1.0 prediction. **One real test-writing finding**: asserting "no dialog provenance on rejection" against `DEFERRED_WF` (which declares `@err: ESCALATE(human)`) initially expected one `StepEnd`, but `DIALOG_REJECTED` is `Signal`-free so NL-9 dispatch fires automatically — two `StepEnd` events land (the rejected `ASK`, then the dispatched `ESCALATE`), both correctly carrying no provenance; the test was corrected, not the code. §3's DG-9/DG-10 rows updated to Implemented. 467 tests pass (was 462, +5: 1 unit test in `observability.rs`, 4 integration tests in `tests/portability.rs`); clippy/fmt clean; `Cargo.toml`/`Cargo.lock` diff empty (LP-1 preserved); no `unwrap`/`panic!`/`expect` added to any production path. |
| 1.2.1 | 2026-09-01 | Core Team | Implementation-time reconciliation of §4.8.3/§4.8.4 to the as-built `crates/nodus` mechanism, landed alongside Phase 30. §4.8.3: `W017`'s trigger is the whole-argument `$var` reference model nodus actually has, not a string-interpolation scan (the crate has no interpolation scanner), and the producer lookup is a **dedicated** single-pass walker (`w017_collect_producers`, recording `target-root → producing command name`) rather than a reuse of `collect_vars_stmt`, which tracks declared/used sets only and has no producer-identity concept. §4.8.4: named precisely which constructs `W016` treats as their own scope — `?IF`/`?ELIF`/`?ELSE` and `~FOR`/`~UNTIL` bodies — and added the two cases the original text omitted: `~PARALLEL` branches are walked for nested scopes but never paired against each other (concurrent, not sequential — no "runs before it" relation for clause (b)), and `?SWITCH` arms/`~MAP`'s command are a single `CommandCall` with no internal sequence, so a dialog appearing as a whole arm's or map's action can never contribute a finding. No behavioural change — `W016`/`W017` ship exactly as designed; this row narrows how the design is described to match what was built. |
| 1.2.0 | 2026-09-01 | Core Team | Closes the DG-11 invariant-traceability gap found at the v1.40.0 nodus replan. New §4.8 realizes DG-11 as two validator advisories rather than runtime behaviour, following its L1's own "a validator MAY advise on" framing: `W016` for a dialog positioned earlier than its own dependencies require, and `W017` for a prompt that inlines a `GEN`/`ANALYZE`-produced artifact instead of referring to it. Decidable today because all three facts it needs already exist — `DIALOG_COMMANDS`, LP-16's `+reversible`/`+external` modifiers (§4.10 of `l2-nodus-portability`), and `collect_vars_stmt`'s read/write walk — so no new AST, grammar, provider call or runtime data is introduced. The section's load-bearing decision is that `W016` requires a **positive** `+reversible=true` declaration on the following step: LP-16 descriptors are omitted rather than defaulted, so firing on undeclared steps would advise moving a confirmation past a possibly irreversible effect — recall traded for soundness, with reach growing as LP-16 is adopted. The brief-quality half of the payload rule is declared **out of core scope** (judging prose is a model act; the crate is model-free per LP-1) rather than left silently unimplemented. `Paused`/resume (DG-4) and memoization (DG-9) untouched. |
| 1.1.0 | 2026-07-31 | Core Team | Closes the DG-9/DG-10 invariant-traceability gap flagged at the v1.29.0 nodus replan. New §4.7 designs both: DG-9's `+remember` marker needs no grammar change (modifiers are already unconstrained free-form pass-through to `DialogProvider::ask`/`confirm`); its one real nodus-side obligation — a distinct trace provenance on a memoized resolution — realizes as a new `DialogOutcome::Remembered(Value)` variant bound through `Answer`'s exact path, plus a new `dialog_provenance: Option<DialogProvenance>` field on the shared `EventAnnotations` carrier (the HO-8/9/10/11/13/16/17 closed-taxonomy-via-optional-field precedent, not a new event type). No new `DialogProvider` trait method: `ask`/`confirm` already receive the raw `modifiers` slice, so a host's own recall/governance/fit-check logic (L1 §4.6's pseudocode) lives entirely inside its existing method body. **DG-10 found to need no separate mechanism at all** — its recurrence/promotion pseudocode is 100% host-side, operating on the host's own durable store plus the DG-9 provenance tag nodus already emits, the same "rides an existing signal, no enumerated list" shape this session's NL-9 dispatch and LP-17 `SETTLEMENT_UNACCOUNTED` also use. §3 gains both compliance rows; §5 gains three rejected alternatives (a second trait method, a dedicated event type, a nodus-side recurrence counter) each traced to an existing precedent. Design only — nothing landed in `crates/nodus` this pass. |
| 1.0.0 | 2026-06-27 | Core Team | Initial spec — Rust realization of the dialog contract: `ASK`/`CONFIRM` vocabulary, `Status::Paused` + `ResumeDescriptor`, `DialogProvider` + `DefaultDialogProvider` (synchronous default-or-pause), `ExtensionRole::Dialog` manifest binding, executor dispatch, `run_with_dialog` combinators; DG-1…DG-8 compliance table. |
