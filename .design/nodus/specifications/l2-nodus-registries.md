# Nodus Closed Vocabulary Registries Implementation (Rust)

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Status:** Stable
**Layer:** implementation
**Implements:** l1-nodus-language.md

## Overview

The crate treats `~flag` analysis extractors, `^validator` rules, and `@in`
field types as free-form text: any token lexes and parses without a vocabulary
check. `l1-nodus-language.md` §4.6 closes this by declaring **closed registries**
for analysis flags, validators, and primitive types that a conforming
implementation should validate against, strengthening NL-1 (schema-first
vocabulary). This spec specifies the Rust realization: the three registries as
`vocab` data, the `Schema` query surface that consults them, and the advisory
validator diagnostics emitted for tokens outside the registries.

The concrete registry contents are the v0.7 sets enumerated in
`l2-nodus-runtime.md` §4.7(f); this spec does not restate them as prose — it
specifies how they are stored and checked.

## Related Specifications

- [l1-nodus-language.md](l1-nodus-language.md) — NL-1 schema-first vocabulary contract this spec strengthens; §4.6 declares the closed registries
- [l2-nodus-runtime.md](l2-nodus-runtime.md) — the runtime crate this extends; `vocab` constants, `Schema` query methods, the validator; §4.7(f) enumerates the registry contents
- [l2-nodus-errors.md](l2-nodus-errors.md) — error/diagnostic conventions; registry checks are advisory (warning severity), distinct from the `NODUS:*` runtime taxonomy

## 1. Motivation

Free-form flags and validators let a typo (`~sentimet`, `^reqired`) pass
validation silently and only surface as a no-op at run time, contradicting the
schema-first promise of NL-1. Closing the registries gives the validator the
data to flag an unknown extractor, validator, or type before execution, while
keeping the check advisory so existing workflows that lean on host-specific
extensions are not hard-broken.

## 2. Constraints & Assumptions

- No new external dependency (LP-1): the registries are in-tree `&[&str]` constants beside `KNOWN_COMMANDS`.
- The registries follow the LP-4 isolation rule: they are builtin constants, never mutated; a host extends vocabulary through the `SchemaProvider` seam, not by editing these.
- Validators may carry a colon-delimited argument (`len:n`, `lang:code`, `sentiment:op:n`); the registry holds the validator **name** (the segment before the first `:`), and the check validates the name, not the argument.
- Registry checks are **advisory** (warning severity): an unknown flag/validator/type is reported but does not, by itself, block execution. This avoids a breaking change to workflows using host extensions; promotion to a hard error is a future amendment.
- The checks run in the existing validator pass; no new pipeline stage is introduced.

## 3. Invariant Compliance

| L1 Invariant | Rust Enforcement |
| --- | --- |
| NL-1 Schema-first | The validator now consults closed registries for `~flag`, `^validator`, and `@in` field types, so an out-of-vocabulary extractor/validator/type is surfaced at validation rather than silently ignored at run time — extending NL-1 beyond commands. |
| NL-7 Closed value type system | The primitive-type registry is the finite type set (`str/int/float/bool/list/obj/url/ts/null/any`); a field type outside it is flagged, reinforcing the closed value space. |
| NL-9 Typed I/O contract | `@in` field types are validated against the primitive registry, so the public input contract is checked against a known type vocabulary. |

## 4. Detailed Design

### 4.1 Registries as `vocab` data

Three constants beside `KNOWN_COMMANDS`, populated from `l2-nodus-runtime.md`
§4.7(f):

```text
[REFERENCE]
pub const KNOWN_FLAGS: &[&str];        // analysis extractors (~flag)
pub const KNOWN_VALIDATORS: &[&str];   // validator names (^validator, pre-colon segment)
pub const PRIMITIVE_TYPES: &[&str];    // @in field types
```

### 4.2 `Schema` query surface

```text
[REFERENCE]
impl Schema {
    pub fn is_known_flag(&self, name: &str) -> bool;
    pub fn is_known_validator(&self, name: &str) -> bool; // matches the pre-colon name
    pub fn is_known_type(&self, name: &str) -> bool;
}
```

`is_known_validator` splits the token on the first `:` and matches the leading
name, so `len:32` and `len` both resolve to the `len` validator.

### 4.3 Validator diagnostics (advisory)

The validator gains three advisory (warning-severity) diagnostics, emitted with
the next available `W0xx` codes in `validator.rs`:

| Condition | Diagnostic |
| --- | --- |
| `~flag` not in `KNOWN_FLAGS` | warning — "unknown analysis flag `{name}`" |
| `^validator` name not in `KNOWN_VALIDATORS` | warning — "unknown validator `{name}`" |
| `@in` field type not in `PRIMITIVE_TYPES` | warning — "unknown field type `{name}`" |

Warnings do not set `ValidationReport::has_errors`, so they never block a run
(NL-4 is unaffected). The exact `W0xx` numbers are assigned at implementation
time against the validator's existing code set.

## 5. Drawbacks & Alternatives

- **Hard errors instead of warnings**: rejected for now — it would break workflows that rely on host-specific flags/validators before the `SchemaProvider` path is wired to extend these registries. Advisory first; hard-error promotion is a later amendment once host extension is in place.
- **Storing validators with their argument grammar** (e.g. a parser per validator): rejected — out of scope; the registry validates the name, and argument validation is a richer future feature.
- **Folding into `KNOWN_COMMANDS`**: rejected — flags, validators, and types are distinct token classes with distinct call sites; conflating them would weaken the per-class check.

## 6. Implementation Notes

- The three constants and their `Schema` queries mirror the existing `KNOWN_COMMANDS` / `is_command` pattern exactly — the same "vocabulary as data" shape.
- Host extension of these registries (via `SchemaProvider`) is a natural follow-on, paralleling `host_commands`; it is not required for this advisory baseline.
