# Harness Optimization

**Version:** 1.1.0
**Status:** Stable
**Layer:** concept

## Overview

An agent's realized capability depends not only on the model but on the **harness** —
the code that decides what context to collect, store, retrieve, and show. cronus
already knows how to *evolve* one harness against evidence (`l1-harness-engineering`)
and how to *measure* a model×harness pair (`l1-agent-coevaluation`). What it does not
yet own is the third, unifying activity: **searching a space of harness candidates
toward a frontier** — an outer-loop optimizer that proposes candidates, evaluates them,
and keeps the non-dominated best, instead of hand-tuning or hill-climbing a single
lineage.

This spec defines that optimizer. The harness is a point in a **candidate space**; an
**outer loop** (propose → evaluate → compare → select) runs above an **inner runtime**
(execute a candidate on tasks, write its archive). Candidates are generated from a
declared **mutation space**, scored by the existing evaluation machinery, and the
optimizer maintains a durable **frontier** of non-dominated candidates — partitioned by
comparability so only like-for-like candidates compete. A baseline may be reused rather
than rerun, but only when a **task-selection hash** proves it comparable; and a
candidate is accepted only when it improves *without* regressing beyond a bound and the
gain survives on held-out tasks. It is the *optimization* layer; it composes, and never
re-implements, evolution, scoring, and attestation.

## Related Specifications

- [l1-harness-engineering.md](l1-harness-engineering.md) — evolves ONE candidate along a lineage (HE-4/HE-5); this spec searches MANY over a space and composes HE-3 frozen pipeline, HE-6 held-out transfer, HE-8/HE-9 artifact-rich context.
- [l1-agent-coevaluation.md](l1-agent-coevaluation.md) — scores + comparability (ACE-5) + slices the optimizer's candidates read; measurement, which this spec turns into a search signal.
- [l1-evaluation-suites.md](l1-evaluation-suites.md) — grading machinery (ES-5 weighted metrics, ES-9 baseline/regression, ES-14 quality-tier) the acceptance rule and objective vector reuse.
- [l1-attestation.md](l1-attestation.md) — content-addressed candidate/config hashes (AT-2) the archive and frontier key on.
- [l1-nodus-environment.md](../../nodus/specifications/l1-nodus-environment.md) — a graded run (reward + trajectory) is one candidate's evaluation; NE-12 makes it an archivable candidate result.
- [l2-self-improvement.md](l2-self-improvement.md) — best-vs-current rollout gating; a scalar-best special case of the frontier here.

## 1. Motivation

The three activities are genuinely distinct, and only two are specified:

- **Evolve one harness** (`l1-harness-engineering`) is a hill-climb on a single lineage:
  make an evidence-backed, single-component change; keep it if it helps; append to
  history. It never explores a *space* or keeps a *set* of alternatives.
- **Measure a pair** (`l1-agent-coevaluation`) is a diagnostic matrix: run (model,
  harness) over labeled tasks, read the gaps and slices. It tells you *where* a harness
  is weak, not *how to search* for a better one.
- **Search the space** — the missing piece — treats the harness as one point among
  many, generates candidates from a mutation space, and maintains a frontier of the
  non-dominated best. Its value over a hill-climb: it escapes local optima (a set, not
  a point), it reuses comparable baselines instead of paying to rerun them, and it makes
  "better" an honest, regression-bounded, held-out-verified judgment rather than a raw
  scalar max. Its value over measurement: it *acts* on the scores to move the frontier.

Without this concept, harness improvement is a single-lineage hill-climb that can stall
in a local optimum, re-pay for baselines it already has, and credit a "win" that
overfits the tasks it was tuned on. The invariants below make the search principled.

## 2. Constraints & Assumptions

- The optimizer searches over harness *procedure/config*, never model weights (weight
  tuning is a separate, out-of-scope lever) and never the inner runtime itself (HX-2).
- Evaluation is non-deterministic; the frontier reflects distributions per candidate,
  reusing the trials/stability model of `l1-evaluation-suites` (ES-6). This spec adds
  the search structure, not a new grader.
- Objectives are a *vector* (quality, cost, latency, stability, safety), so "best" is a
  non-dominated *set* (a frontier), not a single number; a scalar objective is the
  1-dimensional special case.
- The search is single-node and local (archive + frontier on disk); this is an
  optimization concept, not a distributed compute concept (INV-8).

## 3. Core Invariants

Rules every Layer 2 implementation MUST NOT violate:

- **HX-1 Harness space is searchable**: the harness is treated as a point in a candidate
  space searched by an outer-loop optimizer — propose, evaluate, compare, select — not
  only a single artifact hand-tuned or hill-climbed. The optimizer's product is a
  frontier of candidates, not one edited harness.

- **HX-2 Outer-loop / inner-runtime separation**: the optimizer (outer loop) is separate
  from the execution backend (inner runtime that runs a candidate on tasks and writes
  its archive). The optimizer proposes and selects over candidates; it MUST NOT mutate
  the inner runtime, and a candidate's execution is frozen while it is scored
  (composes `l1-harness-engineering` HE-3).

- **HX-3 Content-addressed archived candidates**: each candidate is content-addressed (a
  candidate hash over its code + config), resolvable by stable identity, and each
  evaluation writes a durable archive (a manifest, a summary, and per-task results).
  Provenance — candidate hash, config hash, launcher/context — travels with every
  result (composes `l1-attestation` AT-2, `l1-harness-engineering` append-only HE-7).

- **HX-4 Trace-rich proposer**: the candidate proposer has access to prior candidates'
  **source, scores, AND execution traces** through the archive — not only scalar scores
  or short summaries. Richer diagnostic context is a first-class requirement of the
  proposer, not an optional extra (composes HE-8 artifact extraction, HE-9 context
  freshness, `l1-dynamic-harness` DH-7 sourced experience).

- **HX-5 Declared, bounded mutation space**: candidates are generated by mutations drawn
  from a **declared** mutation space; the conservative default wraps a seed candidate
  rather than rewriting its core, bounding blast radius. The space is explicit and its
  mutations reproducible, so a search is repeatable and a variant is traceable to
  `(seed, mutation)` (composes HE-5 single-component change).

- **HX-6 Frontier of non-dominated candidates**: the optimizer maintains a **frontier** —
  the set of candidates not dominated across the objective vector (quality, cost,
  latency, stability, safety) — not a single scalar best. A candidate enters the
  frontier only if it is non-dominated; a dominated candidate is archived but not on the
  frontier. The frontier is both the baseline source and the search target (a scalar
  best with a regression guard is the 1-objective special case).

- **HX-7 Comparability-partitioned frontier and guarded baseline reuse**: candidates
  compete, and a baseline is reused, only **within a comparability partition** — keyed
  by a **task-selection hash** (plus the frozen-contract check of `l1-agent-coevaluation`
  ACE-5). A prior run may serve as the baseline instead of rerunning it *only if* its
  task-selection hash matches the candidate's; otherwise a fresh baseline run is
  required. Comparing candidates that ran on different task sets is forbidden.

- **HX-8 Regression-bounded, held-out-honest acceptance**: a candidate is accepted as
  "better" only if it improves the objective **and** does not regress more than a
  declared bounded fraction of tasks — never a raw scalar maximum. The credited gain
  must survive on **held-out** tasks not used to propose it (train/eval-disjointness);
  and reward-hacking guards reject a gain that games the metric rather than the task. A
  win that regresses too much, overfits the tuning set, or games the grader is not a win
  (composes HE-6 transfer validity, `l1-evaluation-suites` ES-9/ES-13/ES-14).

- **HX-9 Budgeted, terminating search**: the search is bounded by an explicit budget
  (candidate count, evaluation count, wall-clock, or cost) and terminates on a declared
  criterion — budget exhausted, frontier stagnation, or target met. An unbounded search
  that never terminates is forbidden; the budget and termination reason are recorded.

- **HX-10 Durable, concurrency-safe, observable frontier**: the frontier and every
  candidate's provenance and scores are persisted durably with concurrency-safe writes
  (no lost updates under parallel evaluation) and are observable, so the search is
  auditable, **resumable** across restarts, and the frontier's evolution is inspectable.

- **HX-11 Budget-normalized evaluation & mutation-invariant metric**: [ADDED v1.1.0]
  when candidates in one search differ in dimensions that affect resource consumption
  (size, structure, strategy), their evaluations MUST be **budget-comparable**: the
  preferred design is **budget normalization** — the evaluation contract fixes the
  **resource budget** (wall-clock, compute, tokens, trials), not the workload, and every
  candidate is measured on **outcome achieved within that fixed budget** — so radically
  heterogeneous candidates compete directly and fairly, and efficiency is absorbed into
  the outcome (a faster candidate does more inside the budget) instead of being a second
  axis to hand-weigh. Where budgets do differ, the difference **partitions the frontier**
  (HX-7, sharpening the comparability contract's a-longer-budget-is-a-different-task
  rule into a design principle): scores earned under different budgets never compete.
  A budget-normalized optimum is honestly **platform-relative** — the best candidate
  *for this platform within this budget* — so the budget and the platform are recorded
  with every score (composing MR-14's estimate-vs-measurement honesty). And the scoring
  **metric MUST be mutation-invariant**: chosen so it remains meaningful across the
  *entire* mutable candidate space — a candidate mutation MUST NOT be able to change
  what the metric measures (a metric a mutation can redefine lets the search optimize
  the metric's blind spot rather than the outcome, a criteria-drift sibling of the
  loop-governance oracle-ownership rule).

## 4. Detailed Design

### 4.1 Outer Loop over Inner Runtime

```text
[REFERENCE]
outer loop (this spec)                     inner runtime (l1-harness-engineering backend)
  propose(archive) -> candidate    ──────►  run(candidate, tasks) -> archive
  evaluate(candidate)              ◄──────  (manifest, summary, per-task results, traces)
  compare(candidate, baseline)                                    │
  update_frontier(result)                                         │
  select next / terminate (HX-9)                                  ▼
```

The outer loop never touches how a candidate runs; it only decides which candidates to
try and which to keep (HX-2).

### 4.2 Candidate, Archive, Provenance

```text
[REFERENCE]
Candidate := { id, hash(code ∥ config), source, config, seed?, mutation? }   // HX-3/HX-5
Archive(candidate) := { manifest, summary, tasks[ {name, passed, reward, trace} ] }  // HX-3/HX-4
Provenance := { candidate_hash, config_hash, launcher, task_selection_hash }  // HX-3/HX-7
```

The proposer reads whole archives — code, scores, and traces — not just the summary
(HX-4).

### 4.3 Mutation Space

```text
[REFERENCE]
MutationSpace := closed set of declared mutations               // HX-5
variant(seed, mutation) := wrap(seed, mutation)                  // conservative default
name(variant) := f"{seed}__{mutation}"                          // traceable to (seed, mutation)
```

Mutations are deterministic and reproducible; the default wraps rather than rewrites, so
a variant's blast radius is bounded and its provenance clear.

### 4.4 The Frontier

```text
[REFERENCE]
dominates(a, b) := a ≥ b on every objective AND a > b on at least one   // Pareto
update_frontier(f, c):
    partition := f[c.task_selection_hash]                        // HX-7 comparability partition
    if ∃ x ∈ partition: dominates(x, c):   archive c, do not add    // dominated
    else:                                  add c; drop any x now dominated by c   // HX-6
persist(f)  with an exclusive lock, atomic temp-file-then-rename   // HX-10 no lost updates
```

The frontier is keyed by comparability partition: a candidate is compared and admitted
only against candidates that ran the same task selection (HX-7).

### 4.5 Baseline Reuse Guard

```text
[REFERENCE]
resolve_baseline(candidate, frontier, prior_run?):
    if prior_run and prior_run.task_selection_hash == candidate.task_selection_hash:
        return reuse(prior_run)                                  // HX-7 comparable → cheap
    if frontier.best(candidate.task_selection_hash) exists:
        return frontier_best                                     // frontier-backed baseline
    return REQUIRES_FRESH_RUN                                    // not comparable → rerun
```

Reuse is a cost optimization *gated by comparability*: an incomparable baseline is never
silently used; the search pays for a fresh run instead.

### 4.6 Division of Labour

| Concern | Owner |
| --- | --- |
| Search the candidate space; maintain the frontier; guard reuse; accept honestly | this spec |
| Evolve one candidate (evidence-backed, single-component change) | `l1-harness-engineering` |
| Score a candidate; comparability contract; slices | `l1-agent-coevaluation` / `l1-evaluation-suites` |
| Content-address a candidate | `l1-attestation` |
| Execute one graded run (reward + trajectory) | `l1-nodus-environment` |

This spec adds the *search + frontier* structure; it never re-implements a grader, an
evolver, or a runtime.

## 5. Implementation Notes

1. Key the frontier and every comparison by the comparability partition first (HX-7); a
   comparison drawn across partitions is a silent correctness bug.
2. Persist the frontier under an exclusive lock with atomic replace (HX-10) so parallel
   evaluations never lose an update; make the search resumable from the persisted state.
3. Default the mutation space to wrappers (HX-5); admit core-rewriting mutations only
   behind the same safety gate a single-component change uses.
4. Hold out a task split for acceptance (HX-8); never accept on the split used to
   propose.

## 6. Drawbacks & Alternatives

- **Search cost.** Evaluating many candidates is expensive. Mitigated by comparability-
  guarded baseline reuse (HX-7 — don't rerun a comparable baseline), a budget (HX-9), and
  a conservative mutation space (HX-5 — cheap wrappers before expensive rewrites).
- **Frontier bookkeeping.** Maintaining a non-dominated set is more machinery than a
  single best. Justified: a set escapes local optima a hill-climb cannot, and the
  1-objective case degenerates to a best-with-guard cheaply.
- **Alternative — fold into `l1-harness-engineering`.** Rejected: engineering evolves ONE
  harness along a lineage; the candidate space, mutation space, frontier, and
  comparability-guarded reuse are a distinct *optimization* activity that *drives*
  engineering (it proposes what engineering then refines), the same way coevaluation
  measures what this optimizes.
- **Alternative — scalar best only.** Rejected (HX-6): a single scalar collapses a
  multi-objective trade (a cheaper, slightly-lower-quality harness may be the right pick)
  and hides the frontier a user should choose from.

## Document History

| Version | Date | Author | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1.1.0 | 2026-07-09 | Core Team | Added HX-11 (budget-normalized evaluation & mutation-invariant metric) — when candidates in one search differ in resource-affecting dimensions, evaluations MUST be budget-comparable: preferred design is budget normalization (the evaluation contract fixes the resource budget — wall-clock/compute/tokens/trials — not the workload, every candidate measured on outcome-within-fixed-budget), so radically heterogeneous candidates compete directly, efficiency is absorbed into the outcome rather than hand-weighed as a second axis, and the optimum is honestly platform-relative (budget + platform recorded with every score, composing MR-14 estimate-vs-measurement honesty); differing budgets partition the frontier (HX-7, sharpening the ACE-5 a-longer-budget-is-a-different-task row into a design principle), scores under different budgets never competing; and the scoring metric MUST be mutation-invariant — chosen to remain meaningful across the entire mutable candidate space, a mutation never able to change what the metric measures (a criteria-drift sibling of the loop-governance oracle-ownership rule). Invariant-only addition. Distilled from an adoption pass over an external autonomous-experimentation-loop reference whose core (autonomous modify→run→measure→keep/discard loop, mutable-surface restriction with an immutable oracle, experiment journal) was already realized by HX-1…HX-10 + l1-loop-governance mutation-rights/oracle-ownership + NE-12 — HX-11 captures the genuine delta (fixed-budget comparability + metric invariance). L1 stays Stable (C9, additive); the nodus realization is l1-nodus-environment NE-13. |
| 1.0.0 | 2026-07-02 | Core Team | Initial spec — harness optimization as an outer-loop search over a candidate space, the third activity beside harness-engineering (evolve one) and agent-coevaluation (measure): searchable space (HX-1); outer-loop/inner-runtime separation (HX-2); content-addressed archived candidates with provenance (HX-3); trace-rich proposer reading source+scores+traces (HX-4); declared bounded wrapper-first mutation space (HX-5); frontier of non-dominated candidates across the objective vector, not a scalar best (HX-6); comparability-partitioned frontier + task-selection-hash-guarded baseline reuse or fresh run (HX-7); regression-bounded, held-out-honest, train/eval-disjoint, reward-hacking-guarded acceptance (HX-8); budgeted terminating search (HX-9); durable, concurrency-safe, resumable, observable frontier (HX-10). Composes harness-engineering / agent-coevaluation / evaluation-suites / attestation / nodus-environment; adds the search+frontier layer none owned. HX-8 also formalizes the reward-hacking-filter + train/eval-disjointness mechanic. |
