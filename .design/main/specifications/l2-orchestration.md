# Orchestration

**Version:** 1.0.10
**Status:** Stable
**Layer:** implementation
**Implements:** l1-orchestration.md

## Overview

The concrete coordination mechanics: how the orchestrator delegates via assigned board cards, how agents message each other, how executors are isolated, how the independent judge and the budget circuit-breaker bound a `/goal` run, how the topology adapts as the office grows, and how orchestration state persists for resume.

## Related Specifications

## 1. Motivation

The protocol needs concrete, local, resumable mechanics: a delegation channel (the board), an inter-agent channel (messages), isolation (per-agent sessions), a judge call, and budget accounting — all file-backed so an unattended run survives restarts.

## 2. Constraints & Assumptions

- Delegation rides on the existing board; no parallel task store.
- Executors run in isolated sessions; only summaries return to the orchestrator.
- The judge is a separate evaluation (may use a different/cheaper model) than the executor.
- Budgets come from configuration (per-run and per-agent).

## 3. Invariant Compliance (Layer 2 only)

| L1 Invariant | Implementation |
| --- | --- |
| ORC-1 One orchestrator | The office `manager` (from `<ws>/config.json`) is the sole coordinator; it issues delegations, not implementations. |
| ORC-2 Adaptive topology | When direct reports or domain spread cross a threshold, the orchestrator hires a sub-manager and re-parents agents under it. |
| ORC-3 Intent → board | Plans decompose into board cards (`<ws>/kanban/`) assigned to roles. |
| ORC-4 Delegate/monitor | The orchestrator watches card states and re-assigns/unblocks; it never self-assigns implementation. |
| ORC-5 Context isolation | Each delegated card runs in its own agent session (`<ws>/sessions/`); only a result/summary returns. |
| ORC-6 Judged termination | A `/goal` loop calls an independent judge to decide completion before finishing. |
| ORC-7 Budget circuit-breaker | A per-run budget/iteration counter pauses the loop when exhausted (ties to per-agent budgets). |
| ORC-8 Synchronization | Scheduled briefing routines reconcile agent state into shared office state. |
| ORC-9 Approval gate | High-impact actions require a recorded approval (sub-manager or client) before execution. |
| ORC-10 Resumable | Goal/plan/delegation state persists (board + office state) and reloads on restart. |

## 4. Detailed Design

### 4.1 Delegation and messaging

- **Delegation:** the orchestrator creates a board card with an `assignee` (a hired role) and the task reference; a missing role triggers a hire (role catalog).
- **Messaging:** agents exchange messages (a mailbox) for hand-offs and questions; the orchestrator is the hub for cross-role coordination.
- **Shared task list:** the board is the single shared work list; claiming/assignment is atomic to avoid two agents grabbing the same card.

### 4.2 Context-isolated execution

Each delegated unit runs in a fresh agent session with only the context it needs (its card, relevant memory, role persona). Intermediate reasoning stays in that session; the orchestrator receives a concise result and the card's new state (ORC-5) — preventing context rot over long runs.

### 4.3 `/goal` run with judge + budget

```mermaid
graph TD
    START[/goal text/] --> INIT[init run: budget, iteration=0]
    INIT --> LOOP[plan -> delegate -> execute]
    LOOP --> JUDGE[independent judge evaluates goal]
    JUDGE -->|met| FINISH[finish + report]
    JUDGE -->|not met| DEC{budget/iterations left?}
    DEC -->|yes| LOOP
    DEC -->|no| PAUSE[hard-stop: pause + report why]
```

- **Judge:** a separate evaluation step (distinct from the executor, may use a cheaper model) returns met / not-met with reasoning; only it can end the run as "done" (ORC-6).
- **Budget:** the run carries a token/cost/iteration budget; on exhaustion it pauses safely and reports remaining work (ORC-7).

### 4.4 Adaptive topology mechanism

The orchestrator tracks team size and domain spread; crossing a threshold causes it to hire a sub-manager, assign it a department, and re-parent the relevant agents' `reportsTo`. Shrinking reverses this (release sub-manager, flatten). <!-- TBD: concrete thresholds for promoting/flattening sub-managers -->

### 4.5 Command surface

The `/goal` entry point is the autonomy trigger; planning/execution reuse existing core commands.

| Action | CLI | TUI | Library (no code) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| start autonomous goal | `cronus goal <text>` | `/goal <text>` | `orchestrator.goal(text) -> Run` |
| view run progress | `cronus status` | `/status` | `orchestrator.status() -> RunStatus` |
| stop a run | `cronus goal stop` | `/goal stop` | `orchestrator.stop() -> void` |

### 4.6 Agent tier hierarchy

Agents are classified into three tiers at definition time. The tier determines the allowed toolsets, iteration budget defaults, and workspace scope.

```text
[REFERENCE]
AgentTier: "chat" | "reasoning" | "worker"

AgentDefinition {
  name:             String,
  tier:             AgentTier,
  role_id:          Option<String>,          // links to a hired role in the role catalog
  toolsets:         Vec<String>,             // declared toolset names
  iteration_budget: Option<u32>,             // overrides tier default
  workspace_scope:  "session" | "execution" | "isolated",
}
```

| Tier | Typical use | Default iteration budget | Toolset restrictions | Workspace scope |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `chat` | Short interactive turns, clarifications, brief Q&A | 10 | Read-only tools only; `shell` and `code_execution` forbidden | `session` |
| `reasoning` | Planning, analysis, multi-step problem decomposition | 50 | All tools except `code_execution`; `shell` allowed read-only | `session` or `execution` |
| `worker` | Full implementation, file editing, command execution | 90 | All toolsets; must have an execution workspace | `execution` or `isolated` |

#### Static loader validation

At agent definition load time (extension registry activation, workspace bootstrap), each `AgentDefinition` is validated against its tier:

- `chat` agents declaring `shell` or `code_execution` toolsets are rejected with a hard load error.
- `worker` agents without an `execution` or `isolated` workspace scope are rejected.
- Unknown toolset names are rejected (no implicit fallback).

Validation failures are logged as `AgentDefinitionError` and prevent the agent from being loaded. They do not affect other agents in the same workspace.

#### Runtime spawn depth limit

Agents can spawn sub-agents, which can spawn further sub-agents, but the chain is capped:

```text
[REFERENCE]
MAX_SPAWN_DEPTH: u32 = 3
```

When an agent at depth 3 attempts to spawn a child, the call returns `MaxSpawnDepthError` to the parent. The error is surfaced in the parent's tool result and logged. The orchestrator is always at depth 0; its direct delegates are at depth 1, and so on.

#### Toolkit action ranking

When a `reasoning` or `worker` agent has a large tool catalog (> 50 entries), an action-ranking pass narrows the effective tool list before each provider call:

```text
[REFERENCE]
rank_tools(task_description: &str, tools: &[ToolDefinition], top_n: u32) -> Vec<ToolDefinition>:
  scores = []
  for tool in tools:
    verb_score  = verb_overlap(task_description, tool.name)   // CPU-only: match leading verb
    token_score = token_overlap(task_description, tool.description)  // unigram overlap
    scores.push((tool, verb_score + token_score))
  scores.sort_by(|a, b| b.score.partial_cmp(&a.score))
  return scores[..top_n].map(|s| s.tool)
```

- **Default `top_n`**: 20.
- **Ranking is CPU-only** (no LLM call): verb detection extracts the leading verb from the task description and checks if it appears in the tool name; token overlap counts shared unigrams between the task description and the tool's one-line description.
- Ranked tools are placed first in the tool list sent to the provider; remaining tools are omitted.
- Action ranking runs only when the catalog exceeds the threshold; smaller catalogs are sent in full.

### 4.7 Permission ruleset evaluation

Tool calls and agent actions that require user approval go through a ruleset evaluator.
Rulesets are ordered lists of rules; **the last matching rule wins** (not the first).
This allows coarse-grained allow/deny earlier in the list to be overridden by fine-grained
rules appended by the current context.

```text
[REFERENCE]
PermissionRule {
  permission: Pattern,   // e.g. "fs:write:*"
  pattern:    Pattern,   // e.g. "/home/**"
  action:     "allow" | "deny" | "ask"
}

evaluate(permission: String, path: String, rulesets: Vec<Ruleset>) -> PermissionResult:
  // merge rulesets in order; then findLast matching rule
  merged = concat(rulesets)
  rule = merged.findLast(|r|
    Wildcard.match(permission, r.permission) AND Wildcard.match(path, r.pattern)
  )
  return rule?.action ?? "ask"   // default: ask the user

// "ask" triggers an async approval cycle:
PendingApproval {
  id:       PermissionId,
  info:     ApprovalRequest,
  deferred: Deferred<void, RejectedError | CorrectedError>,
}
```

#### Deferred async approval

When `evaluate()` returns `"ask"`, a `Deferred` is created and the pending approval is
registered. The agent suspends at the approval point; execution resumes when the user
responds.

```text
[REFERENCE]
request_approval(request: ApprovalRequest) -> Effect<void, RejectedError>:
  deferred = Deferred.make()
  pending_approvals.insert(request.id, { info: request, deferred })
  yield* deferred.await()   // agent suspends here

approve(id: PermissionId):
  pending_approvals.remove(id)?.deferred.resolve(())

reject(id: PermissionId):
  pending_approvals.remove(id)?.deferred.reject(RejectedError)
```

#### Scope-based finalizer cleanup

All pending approvals are registered in a scoped context. When the scope closes (session
end, agent cancellation, turn abort), the finalizer rejects every unresolved Deferred:

```text
[REFERENCE]
scope.finalizer:
  for (id, entry) in pending_approvals.drain():
    entry.deferred.reject(RejectedError { reason: "scope_closed" })
```

This prevents the agent from being permanently suspended waiting for an approval that
will never arrive (e.g., after a client disconnects).

### 4.8 Agent mode and on-demand generation

#### Agent mode

Every agent definition carries a `mode` that determines which messages it receives in a
multi-agent session:

```text
[REFERENCE]
AgentMode: "subagent" | "primary" | "all"

"primary"  — receives the conversation from the user's perspective;
             owns the session lifecycle; default for interactive agents.
"subagent" — receives only the delegation request from its parent;
             returns a structured result; never sees the full user history.
"all"      — receives every message regardless of source; used for monitor/observer
             roles that need full visibility (e.g., duplicate-PR detectors, audit agents).
```

`mode` is declared in the agent definition frontmatter (see `l2-extension-registry.md §4.10`).
The orchestrator uses it when routing a delegation to select the correct message slice.

#### On-demand agent generation

When the orchestrator needs an agent for a task that has no pre-defined definition, it can
generate one on demand from a description:

```text
[REFERENCE]
generate_agent(description: String, model?: ModelRef) -> AgentDefinition:
  // Issues a structured LLM call with the description as input.
  // Returns a validated AgentDefinition (name, mode, tool access, system prompt).
  // The generated definition is ephemeral — not persisted to the registry unless
  // the user explicitly saves it via `cronus ext add --from-generated <id>`.
```

Generated agents receive a `source: "generated"` tag; the quality pipeline scans them
before the orchestrator uses them for the first time.

### 4.9 Tool terminate batch semantics

Each tool's `execute()` call may return an optional `terminate` hint that signals the
agent loop to stop after the current tool batch without issuing another model call.

```text
[REFERENCE]
AgentToolResult {
  content:    Vec<TextContent | ImageContent>,
  details:    T,
  terminate?: bool,   // hint: agent should stop after this batch
}
```

**Batch rule**: `terminate` causes an early stop only when **all** tools in the current
batch return `terminate: true`. A single tool returning `terminate: false` (or not
setting the field) allows the batch to complete normally and the agent loop to continue.

This prevents a sub-task tool from prematurely halting the agent when it is invoked in
parallel with other tools that have not yet completed their work. The all-or-nothing
check ensures every concurrently-running tool has completed before the loop decides to
stop.

```text
[REFERENCE]
executeToolCalls(tool_calls, config) -> ToolResultMessage[]:
  results = run_in_configured_mode(tool_calls)   // sequential or parallel per §4.10
  hasMoreWork = not all(r.terminate == true for r in results)
  if not hasMoreWork:
    // signal outer loop to break — no further model call
    mark_terminate_batch()
  return results
```

### 4.10 Agent loop configuration hooks

The agent loop exposes a set of configuration hooks that allow callers (orchestrator,
TUI, extension layer) to customise execution without touching the loop's core logic.
Hooks cover: tool pre/post-processing, stop conditions, and per-turn context mutation.

```text
[REFERENCE]
AgentLoopConfig {
  // Tool lifecycle
  beforeToolCall(tool_name, args, signal) -> BeforeToolCallResult?
    // Run before every tool execution. Return { block: true, reason: string }
    // to prevent the tool from running and return an error result to the model.
    // Mutation of args in place is the mechanism for argument patching.

  afterToolCall(tool_name, args, result) -> AfterToolCallResult?
    // Run after every tool execution. Return a partial override object:
    //   { content?, details?, isError?, terminate? }
    // Fields are applied field-by-field (no deep merge). Omit a field to keep the
    // tool's original value. Use to inject structured details, mask errors, or force
    // terminate semantics.

  // Stop control
  shouldStopAfterTurn(assistant_message) -> bool
    // Called after each model response, before checking for tool calls.
    // Return true to exit the inner loop after the current turn.

  // Context preparation
  prepareNextTurn(context, outcome) -> PreparedTurn?
    // Called between inner loop iterations. May return a new context, model ref,
    // or thinking level for the next provider call. Enables mid-run adaptive model
    // switching without restarting the session.

  transformContext(messages) -> AgentMessage[]
    // Called before every provider call. Prune, reorder, or inject messages at the
    // AgentMessage[] level. The returned list replaces the current context for this
    // provider call only — persistent context is unchanged.

  convertToLlm(messages) -> ProviderMessage[]
    // Convert AgentMessage[] to the provider's wire format. Required when custom
    // message types (see CustomAgentMessages) exist in the context; the provider
    // SDK cannot handle unknown role types.

  // Message injection
  getSteeringMessages(messages) -> AgentMessage[]
    // Return messages to inject before the next provider call (inner loop).
    // Empty list = no injection. Called every turn so the hook can decide
    // dynamically whether steering is needed.

  getFollowUpMessages(result_messages) -> AgentMessage[]?
    // Return messages to inject after the inner loop exits (outer loop).
    // Non-empty = re-enter inner loop with injected messages appended.
    // None or empty = outer loop exits.

  // Authentication
  getApiKey(provider_id) -> string?
    // Called before each provider request. Returning a fresh key handles
    // expiring OAuth tokens without restarting the session.
}

BeforeToolCallResult { block?: bool, reason?: string }

AfterToolCallResult {
  content?:   Vec<TextContent | ImageContent>,
  details?:   T,
  isError?:   bool,
  terminate?: bool,
  // Each field independently overrides the tool's original value.
  // Absent fields preserve the original.
}
```

#### Tool execution modes

Tool execution mode governs whether tools in a batch run sequentially or in parallel:

```text
[REFERENCE]
ToolExecutionMode: "sequential" | "parallel"

Resolution order (first match wins):
  1. Per-tool executionMode on the tool definition (ToolDefinition.executionMode)
  2. Global AgentLoopConfig.toolExecution.mode
  3. Default: "sequential"

When mixing modes in one batch:
  Tools declared "parallel" may run concurrently with each other.
  Tools declared "sequential" (or defaulting to it) run one at a time, in order.
  A "sequential" tool that is batched with "parallel" tools waits for the parallel
  group to finish before it executes (serialized after the parallel group).
```

#### File-mutation queue (multi-agent safety)

When multiple agents operate in the same working directory, concurrent writes to the
same file corrupt content. Each write/edit operation acquires a per-file serialization
lock before touching the filesystem:

```text
[REFERENCE]
withFileMutationQueue(filePath, fn):
  // Resolve real path to handle symlinks (two paths → same file)
  key = realpath(filePath)    // or resolved path if file not yet created
  queue = fileMutationQueues.get(key) ?? Promise.resolve()
  // Chain fn after the current queue head — operations for different files run in parallel
  fileMutationQueues.set(key, queue.then(fn))
  await current_queue_head   // blocks until previous operation on this file completes
  return fn()                // exclusive access window
  // After fn: release the slot; remove key if no further waiters
```

The queue is process-global (shared across all concurrent tool invocations) and uses
path canonicalization to treat symlinks to the same file as the same key. Operations
targeting different files are never blocked by each other.

### 4.11 Architecture spine format

An architecture spine is an **invariants-only consistency contract** — the smallest set of decisions a future builder cannot read off compliant code. It does not describe the implementation; it binds what the implementation must not violate. Everything not in the spine is intentionally deferred.

#### Altitude hierarchy

Spines are authored at three altitudes, each scoping which level of detail they bind:

| Altitude | Governs | Inherits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `initiative` | Cross-feature constraints; keeps feature-level decisions in scope | — |
| `feature` | Cross-epic constraints; keeps epic-level decisions in scope | initiative |
| `epic` | Story-level constraints | feature, initiative |

An epic-altitude spine is typically thin: mostly "Inherited Invariants" from its parent feature spine plus a small local Deferred section.

#### AD-n invariant format

Each decision carries three mandatory fields and optional tags:

```text
[REFERENCE]
### AD-{n} — {decision title}

- **Binds:** {capability IDs, unit IDs, areas, or "all"}
- **Prevents:** {the divergence this decision stops}
- **Rule:** {the enforceable constraint downstream must follow}
```

- IDs are stable and ascending; once assigned they are **never reused or renumbered** (a future builder may reference them in commit messages or issue bodies).
- Tag `[ADOPTED]` when the decision records existing reality rather than a new choice. Adopted decisions require no approval; they document what is already true.
- A decision that contradicts an inherited AD is a conflict to surface explicitly — not a silent override.

#### Inherited invariants table

When a spine inherits from a higher-altitude parent, it carries the parent's ADs/conventions/paradigm as read-only inherited invariants:

```text
[REFERENCE]
| Inherited | From parent | Binds here |
| {AD-id / convention} | {parent spine name} | {what it constrains in this scope} |
```

These entries are never renumbered or re-derived. A local decision that contradicts one must surface the conflict rather than overriding silently.

#### Deferred section

The Deferred section is the other half of the spine contract — it makes explicit what the spine intentionally does not decide and why:

```text
[REFERENCE]
## Deferred

- {decision}: {why it can wait or which altitude should own it}
```

A small Deferred section signals a lean, focused spine. Decisions with open questions belong in Deferred until enough information exists to make them ADs.

#### Consistency conventions table

Spines carry a `Consistency Conventions` table for concerns where independent builders would otherwise drift:

```text
[REFERENCE]
| Concern | Convention |
| Naming (entities, files, interfaces, events) | |
| Data & formats (ids, dates, error shapes, envelopes) | |
| State & cross-cutting (mutation, errors, logging, config, auth) | |
```

Only rows that bind are included; empty rows are omitted.

#### Spine purpose variants

```text
[REFERENCE]
purpose: build-substrate   // default: drives a real implementation (most spines)
purpose: discussion        // exploration spine; not yet binding
purpose: report            // post-hoc architecture review artifact
purpose: deck              // presentation spine; not binding
```

Only `build-substrate` spines create real implementation obligations. Other purposes are informational artifacts that may later be promoted.

### 4.12 Wave-based parallel execution

When a phase consists of multiple plans, those plans can execute in parallel if their file-level and dependency-level footprints do not conflict. The orchestrator pre-computes a `wave` assignment for each plan at **planning time** — so the execution layer requires no graph reasoning at runtime and can simply launch all plans sharing the same wave number simultaneously.

#### Wave assignment rules (pre-computed by planner)

```text
[REFERENCE]
Plans share a wave when ALL of the following hold:
  1. No dependency conflict: neither plan lists the other (or a common ancestor) in depends_on[].
  2. No file conflict: their files_modified[] lists are disjoint — no shared file path.
  3. No submodule intersection: they do not both write to the same crate, package, or app directory.

Tie-breaking: when a plan has any depends_on, its wave is max(wave of dependencies) + 1.
A plan with no depends_on and no conflicts gets wave 1.
```

Plans in the same wave are fully parallel-safe: they can run as independent worktree-isolated executors with no coordination between them beyond the shared git base.

#### Worktree isolation

Each plan that runs in parallel spawns in a fresh git worktree:

```text
[REFERENCE]
Per-plan worktree isolation:
  - Create a temporary worktree from the current HEAD before spawning the executor.
  - The executor commits its work to that worktree.
  - After the executor finishes, merge the worktree branch back into the main branch.
  - If the merge has conflicts: pause the wave, surface the conflict to the user.
  - Remove the worktree after successful merge.

Worktree guard:
  - Before creating a worktree, confirm the plan's files_modified[] has no overlap with
    any currently-active worktree's files_modified[]. If overlap is detected, shift the
    plan to the next wave rather than risk a merge conflict.
```

Plans that must run sequentially (different waves) do not use worktrees — they commit directly.

#### PLAN.md frontmatter schema

```text
[REFERENCE]
PLAN.md required frontmatter:

---
phase: XX-name           # phase this plan belongs to
plan: NN                 # plan number within the phase (sequential)
type: execute | tdd      # execution mode: standard or test-driven-development
wave: N                  # pre-computed wave number; same wave = parallel-safe
depends_on: []           # plan IDs (NN) that must complete before this plan can start
files_modified: []       # file paths this plan will create or change
autonomous: true         # false if this plan contains checkpoint tasks that need human input
requirements: []         # REQUIRED — requirement IDs from the phase's ROADMAP entry

must_haves:
  truths: []             # observable behaviors that must be true in code when done
  artifacts: []          # files that must exist with real (non-stub) implementation
  key_links: []          # critical relationships between artifacts that must be verifiable
---
```

The `must_haves` block is the **goal contract** for the verifier agent: it describes what "done" looks like in observable terms, not in terms of task completion. A plan is not complete when its tasks finish — it is complete when every `truths` item, every `artifacts` item, and every `key_links` item can be confirmed in the codebase.

### 4.13 Safe resume gate

Before spawning an executor for a plan, the orchestrator runs a safe-resume check to detect partial prior execution:

```text
[REFERENCE]
Safe resume gate (runs before every executor spawn):

1. Run: git log --oneline --grep="plan-{NN}" --grep="phase-{XX}" for this plan's commits.
2. If no commits found:
   → Clean slate. Spawn executor normally.
3. If commits found AND SUMMARY.md exists:
   → Plan already complete. Skip executor, load SUMMARY.md.
4. If commits found AND SUMMARY.md is missing:
   → Partial execution detected. Offer three options:
     (a) Close out: spawn a close-out executor to write SUMMARY.md from existing commits.
     (b) Re-execute: discard prior commits, reset the branch to pre-plan HEAD, re-execute.
     (c) Mark-and-skip: write a minimal SUMMARY.md flagging the plan as "incomplete — skipped"
         and continue. Requires explicit user acknowledgment.

The orchestrator MUST NOT auto-advance past option (a/b/c) — this is a required human gate.
```

The safe resume gate prevents silent data loss: re-running a plan that already committed work would overwrite commits without warning. The gate surfaces the ambiguity and makes the recovery path explicit.

### 4.14 Checkpoint continuation file

When plan execution encounters a blocking checkpoint (`gate="blocking"`), a continuation file is written so that the auto-advance safety gate can detect the pause:

```text
[REFERENCE]
Checkpoint continuation file: .planning/.continue-here.md

Written when: a blocking checkpoint task (type="checkpoint:decision" or
  type="checkpoint:human-verify" with gate="blocking") is encountered during execution.

Content:
  ---
  plan: NN
  phase: XX-name
  checkpoint_type: decision | human-verify
  blocking_since: <ISO datetime>
  resume_signal: <exact string the user must type to resume>
  context: <one-paragraph summary of what was built and what decision is needed>
  ---

Cleared when: the user provides the resume signal and the executor acknowledges it.

Auto-advance safety gate behavior:
  - Before advancing to the next plan or phase, check for .planning/.continue-here.md.
  - If the file exists: HARD STOP. Do not advance. Surface the file content to the user.
  - Three additional gates block auto-advance:
      1. STATE.md shows status: error or status: failed
      2. VERIFICATION.md has unresolved FAILED findings
      3. Prior phase has plans with commits but missing SUMMARY.md files
```

The continuation file is the mechanism that makes autonomous execution safe: the system can run unattended until it hits a decision point, then pause cleanly and wait for human input rather than making an autonomous choice at a fork.

### 4.15 Artifact dependency graph

A phase's work produces a set of artifacts. Instead of rigid sequential phase gates, the artifact dependency graph declares which artifacts enable which other artifacts — and leaves the execution layer free to produce them in any order that satisfies the declared dependencies. An artifact's `requires` is an enabler, not a blocker: if a dependency is already satisfied (or deliberately skipped for the current task type), downstream work can proceed without waiting.

#### Artifact graph schema

```text
[REFERENCE]
artifact-graph.yaml (per-workspace, stored at <ws>/planning/artifact-graph.yaml):

name: <workspace-name>
version: 1
artifacts:
  - id: <unique-id>
    generates: <file-or-glob>       # what file this artifact produces
    description: <one-line purpose>
    requires: []                    # artifact IDs that must exist before this one can start
    optional: false                 # true = skip silently when not needed (e.g. design for bugfix)
    instruction: |
      AI instructions for generating this artifact — injected into the executor's context.
```

#### Standard artifact chain

The default Cronus artifact chain produces the following directed acyclic graph:

```text
[REFERENCE]
context-md  ──→  plan-md  ──→  summary-md
     │                │
     └──→  decisions  └──→  verification-md

#### Enabler vs. blocker semantics

```text
[REFERENCE]
Enabler semantics:
  - An artifact's requires[] lists what must exist, not what must run first.
  - If a dependency artifact already exists (from a prior phase, prior run, or manual creation):
    → the dependent artifact may start immediately.
  - If a dependency artifact is marked optional=true and the current task type does not need it:
    → skip it and treat its dependents as enabled anyway.
  - If a dependency artifact is missing and NOT optional:
    → the dependent artifact is blocked. Surface the gap to the user.

Example (bug-fix shortcut):
  - decisions: optional=true → skip for bugfix task type
  - plan-md: requires [context-md] only → starts as soon as CONTEXT.md exists
  - Result: bug fixes skip the decision-making phase without manual override
```

#### Artifact status tracking

The graph's current state is tracked in a status file:

```text
[REFERENCE]
planning/artifact-status.json:
{
  "schema": "cronus-orchestration",
  "updated": "<ISO datetime>",
  "artifacts": {
    "context-md":       { "status": "complete", "path": "planning/CONTEXT.md" },
    "decisions":        { "status": "skipped",  "reason": "task-type=bugfix" },
    "plan-md":          { "status": "complete", "path": "planning/PLAN.md" },
    "summary-md":       { "status": "pending",  "path": null },
    "verification-md":  { "status": "pending",  "path": null }
  }
}

Status values:
  pending   — not yet started; dependencies not satisfied or not yet triggered
  enabled   — dependencies satisfied; ready to produce
  in-progress — currently being generated
  complete  — file exists and passes validation
  skipped   — optional artifact explicitly omitted for this run
  failed    — generation was attempted and produced an invalid artifact
```

### 4.16 Change dependency metadata

When a workspace contains multiple in-progress changes (parallel development, feature branches, staged migrations), each change declares its dependency relationships explicitly. This enables the orchestrator to detect conflicts before they happen and surface unblocked work clearly.

#### Per-change metadata schema

```text
[REFERENCE]
<ws>/planning/changes/<change-id>/.change.yaml:

schema: cronus-orchestration
created: <ISO date>

# Dependency relationships
dependsOn: []   # change IDs that must land in the base branch before this change can merge
provides: []    # capability IDs or artifact IDs this change delivers
requires: []    # capabilities or versions that must exist before this change is meaningful
touches: []     # advisory: spec files or subsystem names this change modifies

# Decomposition
parent: null    # set to a change-id if this change was split from a larger change

# Notes
why: |
  One-paragraph rationale for this change's existence.
```

#### Dependency validation rules

```text
[REFERENCE]
Validation (run at plan-time and at archive-time):

  Rule 1: No cycles.
    A change may not declare dependsOn entries that (transitively) depend on itself.
    Detection: topological sort; reject if cycle found.

  Rule 2: dependsOn must be resolvable.
    Each entry in dependsOn[] must be either:
      (a) An active change ID in <ws>/planning/changes/, or
      (b) A capability already present in the base branch's SUMMARY.md provides[] sections.
    Unresolvable: hard error at plan time.

  Rule 3: requires must be satisfiable.
    Each entry in requires[] must match a provides[] from another active change or the base branch.
    Unsatisfied: warning (not error) — the change may proceed but is flagged.

  Rule 4: touches is advisory only.
    Overlapping touches[] across parallel changes generates a warning:
    "Changes A and B both touch 'wave-orchestration'. Verify they don't conflict."

  Rule 5: Archive order.
    A change cannot be archived (moved to Complete) before all its dependsOn changes are archived.
    Attempting to archive out of order: HARD STOP with explanation.
```

#### Change DAG commands

```text
[REFERENCE]
cronus change graph              # Visualize current change dependency DAG
cronus change next               # List unblocked changes (no unsatisfied dependsOn)
cronus change split <id>         # Decompose a large change into child changes
cronus change status             # Show all changes with their dependency state
```

### 4.17 Foundational phase gate

Plans that mix setup work (project scaffold, dependency wiring, infrastructure) with feature work (user-facing stories) risk cascading failures when story tasks start before the foundation is ready.

**Gate rule**: a plan MUST declare at most one `phase: foundation` before any `phase: story` phases. No story task may enter `In Progress` while the foundation phase contains an incomplete task.

#### Foundation phase in PLAN.md

```yaml
phases:
  - id: foundation
    type: foundation        # reserved type; pre-condition for all stories
    wave: 1
    tasks: [...]
    gate: blocking          # ⚠️ CRITICAL: no story work begins until this phase is Done
  - id: story-user-auth
    type: story
    priority: P1
    wave: 2                 # only starts after foundation gate passes
    depends_on: [foundation]
    tasks: [...]
```

The orchestrator enforces: before spawning any wave-2 agent, it checks that all wave-1 (foundation) tasks carry `status: done`. If any remain, it emits:

```text
⚠️ FOUNDATION GATE: phase "foundation" has N incomplete task(s). Story work blocked.
Remaining: <task-id-list>
```

#### Story prioritization

Stories are ordered by `priority: P1 | P2 | P3`:

- `P1` — MVP; must be done before any non-MVP story begins parallel execution.
- `P2` — important but not launch-blocking.
- `P3` — nice-to-have; deferred unless capacity allows.

Within a priority tier, stories may run in parallel (respecting `depends_on`). Cross-tier parallelism is disallowed: all P1 stories must complete before any P2 story may begin.

#### Foundation completion checkpoint

When the last foundation task completes, the orchestrator emits a checkpoint line before releasing story waves:

```text
✓ Foundation phase complete — story implementation may now begin in parallel.
```

This line appears in the run log and the board card for the foundation phase.

### 4.18 Drift check gate

Plans are written against a specific codebase state. If files change between plan creation and execution, the plan's "Current state" excerpts may no longer match the live code — causing the executor to operate on wrong assumptions.

#### Gate procedure

The drift check runs as the **first action** before any plan executor starts:

```bash
git diff --stat {planned_at_sha}..HEAD -- {in_scope_paths}
```

`planned_at_sha` is recorded in the plan's YAML frontmatter when the plan is created:

```yaml
planned_at:
  sha: "abc1234"
  date: "2026-06-21"
```

If `git diff` returns non-empty output for any in-scope path, the executor reads the "Current state" excerpts from the plan and compares them to the live file at that path.

**Match**: proceed — the drift is in unrelated lines.  
**Diverge**: STOP and report:

```text
DRIFT DETECTED: Plan "plans/042-user-auth.md" was written against abc1234.
Changed since planning: src/auth/middleware.ts (+23 -5)
Current state excerpt DOES NOT match live code at src/auth/middleware.ts:47.
Action: update the plan's Current state section before re-running.
```

#### Machine-checkable done criteria

Plans include a `## Done Criteria` section with boolean queries — not prose:

```markdown
## Done Criteria
- [ ] `cargo check` exits 0
- [ ] `cargo test` exits 0; ≥N new tests exist
- [ ] `grep -rn "{old_pattern}" src/` returns no matches
- [ ] No files outside in-scope list modified (`git status --short`)
- [ ] `plans/README.md` status row updated to `Done`
```

All criteria must hold before the executor marks the plan complete. If any criterion fails, the executor stops and reports which check failed with the actual command output.

#### Self-contained context rule

Plans MUST be self-contained. Forbidden references:

- "as we discussed", "per our earlier decision", "see the previous session"

Required: inline the relevant excerpts (file:line), the applicable convention, and the rationale. Plans must be executable by any agent, not only the one that wrote them.

### 4.19 Continuous checkpoint mode

Long-running mission sessions are vulnerable to crashes, context-window exhaustion, or interruption. Explicit checkpointing at task milestones enables session recovery without losing decision history.

**Configuration:** `config.json` → `mission.checkpoint_mode: "explicit" | "continuous"` (default: `"explicit"`)

**Explicit mode (default):** A checkpoint is written only when the user runs `cronus mission checkpoint` or when a phase transitions to `Done`.

**Continuous mode:** A checkpoint is written automatically after each significant step — a tool-call group that changes one or more tracked files. This adds bookkeeping overhead but guarantees recovery at any point.

**Checkpoint format:** Each checkpoint is a YAML document written to `.planning/checkpoints/cp-{timestamp}.yaml`:

```yaml
timestamp: 2026-06-21T15:30:00Z
session_id: {id}
skill: mission
phase: phase-2
decisions_made:
  - "Selected sqlite-vec: better Rust FFI surface than the alternative"
  - "Deferred mobile push: not required for v1 milestone"
remaining_steps:
  - "Implement storage adapter"
  - "Write integration tests"
failed_approaches:
  - "Attempted async batch write: deadlock under concurrent read — reverted"
context_sha: {git-sha-at-checkpoint-time}
```

**Recovery:** `cronus mission restore [--from cp-{timestamp}]` reads the latest (or named) checkpoint, reconstructs session state, and resumes the `remaining_steps` list. When `context_sha` differs from HEAD, a drift notice is emitted before recovery proceeds (see §4.18 drift check gate).

**WIP commit strategy (opt-in):** When `mission.checkpoint_push: true`, the executor also creates a local git commit with a `WIP: [cronus-cp]` prefix and the checkpoint YAML as the commit body. Before finalization, `cronus mission squash` collapses all `WIP: [cronus-cp]` commits into a single clean commit; non-WIP commits are preserved.

**Push behavior:** WIP commits are local-only by default (`checkpoint_push: false`). Set `checkpoint_push: true` to push the WIP branch to the remote — useful for CI-monitored or pair sessions.

### 4.20 Three-tier durability model

Different orchestration tasks have different time horizons, fault-tolerance requirements, and result-delivery expectations. Collapsing them into a single primitive produces systems that are either too heavy (synchronous delegation for fire-and-forget work) or too fragile (scheduled jobs for tasks that need an immediate result).

**Tier definitions:**

| Tier | Name | Duration | Durability | Use when |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Delegation | Seconds–minutes | Non-durable (parent cancel = child cancel) | Parallel subtasks; parent waits for result before continuing |
| 2 | Scheduled | Minutes–days | Durable (survives restart, not crash) | Background work; fire-and-forget; recurring maintenance |
| 3 | Queue | Hours–indefinite | Durable + persistent (survives crash; audit trail) | Human-queued tasks; multi-agent work pools; async delivery |

**Tier 1 — Delegation:**

- Synchronous: parent blocks until the child returns a summary.
- Isolated context + session: the child cannot read parent context or tool results.
- Maximum concurrency: bounded (default: 3 parallel subtasks, configurable per goal).
- Leaf vs orchestrator flag: leaf agents cannot re-delegate; orchestrators may spawn sub-workers.
- Failure: child failure is reported to parent; parent decides retry vs abort.

**Tier 2 — Scheduled:**

- Persisted schedule definition (cron expression, duration interval, or ISO timestamp).
- Hard interrupt: maximum run time enforced to prevent runaway jobs (default: 3 minutes).
- Delivery target: session context, external channel (notifications), or file drop.
- Per-job overrides: model, skill set, pre-run script, additional context injection.

**Tier 3 — Queue:**

- Durable storage (SQLite): survives crashes and restarts; board state is authoritative.
- Dispatcher atomically claims tasks; reclaims stale claims after a configurable timeout.
- Worker toolset is gated by the task's declared requirements (no ambient permission creep).
- Isolation: board = hard boundary between offices; tenant = namespace within a board.
- Audit trail: every claim, start, completion, and failure is recorded with timestamp.

**Selection rule:** Choose the lowest tier that satisfies the durability requirement. Queue overhead (dispatch latency, storage, reclaim logic) is real — do not use Tier 3 when Tier 1 or Tier 2 suffices. Do not use Tier 1 for jobs longer than five minutes: parent context may exhaust before the child returns.

## 5. Drawbacks & Alternatives

- **Judge model choice:** too weak a judge mis-confirms; too strong is costly. Mitigated by making the judge model configurable.
- **Mailbox overhead:** message passing adds bookkeeping; justified for coherent multi-agent hand-offs.
- **Alternative — orchestrator executes trivial tasks itself:** rejected; it erodes ORC-1 clarity. Trivial work still goes through a (cheap) role.
- **MAX_SPAWN_DEPTH = 3:** arbitrary but prevents runaway recursion; configurable via workspace config for teams that need deeper delegation chains.
