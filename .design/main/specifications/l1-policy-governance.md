# Policy Governance

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Status:** Stable
**Layer:** concept

## Overview

An administrative control layer over configuration. It defines how settings resolve through ordered tiers, lets an administrator principal fix a *managed* tier that lower tiers cannot override, and gives that tier concrete levers to harden a deployment: restrict the loadable extension / hook / permission-rule surface to a vetted set, constrain which extension sources are trusted, and disable safety-reducing escape hatches. The goal is a deployment an operator can lock down once so that neither a user, a project, nor the agent can silently weaken it.

This is distinct from client security (which protects secrets and confines execution) and from authentication (which decides *who* a principal is). Policy governance decides *what configuration and capability surface a principal is permitted*, and which of those decisions are administrator-final rather than user-discretionary. It applies equally to a single user hardening their own machine, a superadmin setting policy for a small team, or an operator managing a fleet.

## 1. Motivation

Configuration that anyone can change is configuration no one can rely on. A user can paste a setting that disables a safety check; a project file can register an unreviewed hook that runs on every action; a convenience flag can switch off approval prompts wholesale. In a shared or hardened deployment these are not edge cases — they are the default failure mode.

The fix is a precedence-ordered configuration model with an administrator-owned tier at the top that is set out-of-band and cannot be overridden from inside the controlled environment. That tier needs more than key/value overrides: it needs the power to shrink the *capability surface* — to say "only hooks I vetted run here," "only these extension sources are trusted," "the bypass-everything mode does not exist on this machine" — and to do so transparently, so a user can always see what is locked and why. Without this layer, every other security invariant is one user edit away from being switched off.

## 2. Constraints & Assumptions

- The managed tier is stored where the controlled principal cannot write it (a system location, a protected store, or an out-of-band channel); enforcing that storage boundary is an implementation concern, not a guarantee this concept can make on its own.
- Governance restricts and fixes configuration; it does not invent new capabilities. Every lever here gates a surface defined by another spec (extensions, hooks, permission rules, sandbox, approval gates).
- Absent any managed policy, behaviour is identical to an unmanaged install — governance is opt-in and additive, never a hidden default restriction.
- The model is the same at every scale; "administrator" may be the sole user acting deliberately, a team superadmin, or a fleet operator.

## 3. Core Invariants

Rules every Layer 2 implementation MUST NOT violate:

- **PG-1 (Layered precedence):** configuration resolves through an ordered tier chain (managed → … → project → user → built-in default); a higher tier's value overrides lower tiers for the same key. Both the effective value and the tier that supplied it are always resolvable.
- **PG-2 (Managed tier is authoritative):** the top *managed* tier is set out-of-band by an administrator principal and MUST NOT be overridden, weakened, merged-away, or removed by any lower tier. A value fixed by the managed tier is final within the controlled environment.
- **PG-3 (Inspectable provenance):** for every effective setting the system can report its originating tier ("setting sources"). Managed restrictions are never applied silently — a user can always discover what is locked and that it is administrator-set.
- **PG-4 (Surface lockdown — managed-only modes):** the managed tier can restrict the *loadable surface* of each governable artifact class — extensions, hooks, permission rules — to an administrator-vetted set. When a class is set "managed-only," user- and project-supplied instances of that class are not loaded. Lockdown is declared per class and is default-off.
- **PG-5 (Trusted-source restriction):** the managed tier can constrain which extension sources (registries / distribution catalogs) are trusted; only artifacts originating from an allowlisted source may be installed or loaded. This composes with — and never bypasses — the extension supply-chain checks.
- **PG-6 (Escape-hatch governance):** any setting that *reduces* enforced safety (e.g. a mode that bypasses approval gates, or weakens the sandbox) is itself a governed value the managed tier can disable. When disabled, the escape hatch is unavailable regardless of user or project intent.
- **PG-7 (Fail-open absence, fail-safe presence):** with no managed policy present, the system imposes no hidden restriction (behaves as unmanaged). With a managed policy present, every restriction it enforces and every action it denies is auditable (composes with SEC-7).
- **PG-8 (Policy integrity):** the managed policy source is integrity-verified (pinned/hash-checked) before it is trusted; a tampered, substituted, or corrupt policy is detected and the system fails safe (treats it as a hard error, not as "no policy"), reusing the pinning discipline already applied to hooks and tool manifests.

## 4. Detailed Design

### 4.1 Tier Resolution

```text
[REFERENCE]
TIERS (highest → lowest):
  managed   — administrator, out-of-band, un-overridable (PG-2)
  cli       — invocation-time flags
  project   — checked-in project config
  user      — per-user config
  default   — built-in baseline

resolve(key):
    for tier in TIERS:                 // highest first
        if tier defines key: return { value: tier[key], source: tier }   // PG-1, PG-3
    return { value: default[key], source: "default" }
```

A managed-tier value short-circuits resolution: lower tiers are not consulted for that key.

### 4.2 Governable Artifact Classes & Lockdown

Each class names a surface owned by another spec. The managed tier may set each to one of: `open` (default — user/project instances load), `managed-only` (only administrator-supplied instances load), or `off` (the class is disabled entirely).

| Class | Governs | Lockdown effect |
|---|---|---|
| Extensions / plugins | extension registry surface | `managed-only` → only administrator-installed extensions load |
| Hooks | hook system | `managed-only` → user/project hooks are ignored |
| Permission rules | approval-gate allow/ask/deny rules | `managed-only` → only administrator rules apply; user/project rules dropped |
| Extension sources | trusted registries/catalogs | allowlist → installs only from listed sources (PG-5) |
| Escape hatches | safety-reducing modes | `off` → mode unavailable (PG-6) |

### 4.3 Provenance Reporting

A status surface enumerates, per effective setting, its source tier and whether it is locked (managed). This is the user-facing counterpart to PG-3: lockdown is legible, not mysterious. A denied action attributable to policy reports the governing tier in its diagnostic.

### 4.4 Integrity & Fail-Safe

```text
[REFERENCE]
load_managed_policy(source):
    raw := read(source)
    if not integrity_ok(raw):           // PG-8: pinned hash / signature mismatch
        fail_safe("managed policy integrity check failed")   // hard error, not "unmanaged"
    return parse(raw)
```

Distinguishing "no policy" (legitimately unmanaged → PG-7 fail-open) from "policy present but tampered" (→ PG-8 fail-safe hard error) is the security-critical boundary: a substituted policy must never be silently downgraded to "no restrictions."

## 5. Drawbacks & Alternatives

- **Lockout risk:** an over-restrictive managed tier can make a deployment unusable, and by PG-2 the user cannot self-rescue. Mitigated by PG-3 provenance (the user sees the cause) and by keeping administration out-of-band (the administrator can correct it where the policy lives).
- **Alternative — single flat settings file:** simplest, but any principal can disable any safety control; rejected — it is exactly the failure mode PG-2 exists to close.
- **Alternative — fold into client security (l1-security):** rejected; security confines *execution and secrets*, governance controls *configuration authority and capability surface*. Different axis, different administrator model; folding them would overload l1-security and force a wide cascade for an orthogonal concern.
- **Alternative — fold into authentication (l2-multi-user-auth):** rejected; auth decides identity, governance decides permitted configuration. Governance consumes the administrator identity auth provides but adds the policy layer auth explicitly defers ("no RBAC … can extend it later").
