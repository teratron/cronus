# Completion Verification

**Version:** 1.1.0
**Status:** Stable
**Layer:** concept

## Overview

The honesty contract for **claims about work state** — done, passing, fixed, succeeded,
requirements-met. It is the missing member of the grounding family: `l1-claim-verification`
grounds claims about *facts* against sources, `l1-tool-receipts` authenticates that an
*action* happened and its result is real — and this grounds a claim that *work is
complete* against fresh evidence from the authoritative check. The failure it closes is
the highest-frequency dishonesty in autonomous work: asserting "tests pass" without
running them this turn, calling a bug "fixed" because the code changed, reporting
"requirements met" because a suite is green, and — the delegation case — relaying a
sub-agent's self-reported "success" upward as a completion without ever looking at what
it actually produced. The rule is one line: **no completion claim without fresh
verification evidence, and a subordinate's reported success is a signal to verify, never
a verdict to relay.**

## Related Specifications

- [l1-claim-verification.md](l1-claim-verification.md) — the faithfulness-of-*facts* sibling (CV-2/CV-4: a claim needs a cited source); this spec is the same discipline for *work-state* claims, which need a run's fresh evidence rather than a source citation.
- [l1-tool-receipts.md](l1-tool-receipts.md) — TR-3/TR-4 authenticate an action's existence and result via a keyed receipt the runtime witnesses; CMP-3 verifies a *delegated actor's reported* success against an observable artifact — the cross-actor / un-witnessed case receipts do not cover.
- [l1-optimization-integrity.md](l1-optimization-integrity.md) — OI-8 fail-visible (an unrun check is `unverified`, never rendered as `verified`); CMP applies exactly that to completion status.
- [l1-quality-standards.md](l1-quality-standards.md) — owns the definition-of-done *gates* (what must be true to be done); this spec owns the behavioral honesty that a green gate may not be *claimed* without being *run and observed* this turn.
- [l1-orchestration.md](l1-orchestration.md) — ORC-5 isolation / ORC-11 error containment: a delegation boundary summarizes upward; CMP-3 requires that summary's *success* be verified against the subordinate's observable output, not passed through on its word.
- [l1-work-liveness.md](l1-work-liveness.md) — a run's terminal state is a CMP-verified outcome (its real result), never a narrated "it worked"; WL owns the ownership/recovery, CMP owns the honesty of declaring it done.
- [l1-loop-governance.md](l1-loop-governance.md) — LG-4 oracle ownership: the check that proves a completion is independent of the actor that produced the work (a generator does not self-certify done), mirroring the verifier-independence discipline.
- [l1-nodus-observability.md](../../nodus/specifications/l1-nodus-observability.md) — a workflow's `RunResult` (typed status + step outcomes, HO-*) is the observable artifact a host verifies (see nodus-relevance mapping).
- [l1-outcome-confidence.md](l1-outcome-confidence.md) — [ADDED v1.1.0] the probabilistic sibling CMP-6 keeps separate: evidence decides *done*, an estimate decides *how hard to look*; neither may overwrite the other.

## 1. Motivation

An agent that has *almost* finished is under the strongest pressure to say it *has*
finished — the work looks done, the last edit "should" compile, the tired end of a long
task wants to be over. So it writes "Done — all tests pass" without running the tests,
"Fixed" because it changed the code that looked wrong, "Phase complete" because the suite
is green even though a required behavior was never built. Each is a confident, plausible,
*false* status — and the cost lands later: a crash from an undefined function, a shipped
feature that was never implemented, a redirect-and-rework cycle, and the trust the human
withdraws the first time "it's done" turns out to be a lie.

The delegation case is worse because it is invisible. An orchestrator hands a task to a
sub-agent; the sub-agent reports "success"; the orchestrator relays "the task is
complete" upward — having never looked at the diff, the output, or the run result. The
sub-agent may have done nothing, done it wrong, or reported success on a partial. A
self-report is the *least* trustworthy evidence of completion precisely where completion
matters most.

The existing honesty specs do not close this. Claim-verification grounds *factual*
claims against *sources* — a completion claim has no source, it has a *check*.
Tool-receipts authenticate an action the runtime *witnessed* — a subordinate's narrated
success is exactly the un-witnessed, cross-actor case receipts leave open (TR-8). What is
missing is the contract that a claim about work being *done* is backed by fresh evidence
from the check that proves it, and that a delegated success is verified against an
observable artifact the reporter did not author. Built once, it serves every surface that
declares work complete — a status line, a hand-off, a commit message, an orchestrator's
roll-up — instead of each improvising a trust-the-report shortcut.

## 2. Constraints & Assumptions

- This spec governs *claims about work state*, not the work itself. It never decides whether the gates are the right gates (quality-standards) or how work is recovered (work-liveness) — only that a completion status must be earned by fresh evidence before it is asserted.
- "Fresh" means *this turn*: evidence from the authoritative check run now, over the current state — not a prior run, not an extrapolation, not "it should."
- The authoritative check is the one that actually proves the specific claim; a proxy (a linter for a build, a build for tests, one test for a regression fix) is not it.
- A subordinate actor's self-report is input, never evidence; the evidence is the observable artifact it produced (diff, output, run result), read by the delegator.
- Where verification genuinely cannot run, the honest output is an explicit *unverified* state, never a completion claim — degrading honestly, never optimistically.

## 3. Core Invariants

Rules every Layer 2 realization MUST NOT violate. They are technology-neutral.

- **CMP-1 (Fresh evidence before a completion claim):** a claim that work is complete, passing, fixed, or succeeded MUST be backed by verification evidence gathered *this turn* from the authoritative check for that claim — the test run's output and exit code, the build's exit code, the original symptom re-run and now passing. Extrapolation, a prior run, "should pass," confidence, or a partial check is not evidence. Absent fresh evidence, the honest report is the *actual verified* state, not the intended one.

- **CMP-2 (The claim names its check):** every verifiable completion claim is paired with the specific check that proves it — the command, its full output, its exit/failure count — so the claim is reconstructable and falsifiable rather than a bare assertion. A claim whose proving check cannot be named or run is surfaced as *unverified* (composing `l1-optimization-integrity` OI-8), never asserted as done.

- **CMP-3 (Delegated success is verified independently, never relayed on report):** when work is delegated to a subordinate actor — a sub-agent, a tool, an external worker — that actor's *self-reported* success is NOT a completion the delegator may pass upward. The delegator verifies the outcome against an observable artifact the subordinate did not author the report of (the actual diff/changed files, the actual output, the actual run result) before treating the work as done. A subordinate's "success" is a signal to verify, not a verdict to relay.

- **CMP-4 (The check proves the claim, not a weaker proxy):** the check backing a completion claim MUST actually prove *that* claim, not a cheaper stand-in for it — a passing linter does not prove the build compiles, a passing build does not prove the tests pass, one passing test does not prove a regression is fixed (a regression fix is proven only by the symptom failing *before* and passing *after*), and a green suite does not prove the *requirements* are met. A "requirements met" claim is checked against the requirements themselves, item by item, with gaps reported — never inferred from a passing suite. A proxy check reported as if it were the real one is a false completion.

- **CMP-5 (No unverified completion status is surfaced as done):** no surface — a status line, a report, a hand-off, a commit or PR message, an orchestrator's roll-up — presents work as complete or passing on the strength of an unverified assumption or a relayed self-report. The completion status a consumer reads is one the system actually verified; an unverified status is labeled *unverified*, never rendered as done. This is the execution-completion sibling of `l1-claim-verification` CV-2/CV-4 (facts) and `l1-tool-receipts` TR-4 (actions).
- **CMP-6 (A confidence estimate is never evidence, in either direction):** [ADDED v1.1.0] a probabilistic estimate of how likely an outcome is to hold up — however well calibrated, however produced — is **not verification evidence** and MUST NOT satisfy, replace, weaken, shorten, or waive any check CMP-1…CMP-5 require. A high estimate is not a reason to skip a check; a check's absence is not excused by a high estimate. The two answer different questions and compose in one direction only: **evidence decides whether the work is done; an estimate decides how hard to look and whom to involve** — so a *low* estimate may legitimately demand *more* checking than the minimum, while a high one may never demand less. Nor does the converse hold: a passing check does not license suppressing a low estimate from the record or the hand-off, because the estimate's value lies precisely in flagging the gaps no check was written for (silent incompleteness). Both travel with the outcome; neither is permitted to overwrite the other.

> L2 specs cannot reach RFC status until all invariants here are addressed in their "Invariant Compliance" section.

## 4. Detailed Design

### 4.1 The completion gate

```text
[REFERENCE]
claim_complete(work, claim):
    check := authoritative_check_for(claim)         // CMP-4 — the check that PROVES this claim, not a proxy
    if check is None:
        return report(status: UNVERIFIED, reason: "no runnable check")   // CMP-2/CMP-5 — never assert done
    evidence := run(check)                            // CMP-1 — fresh, this turn, over current state
    if not evidence.confirms(claim):                 // read full output, exit code, failure count
        return report(status: evidence.actual_state, proof: evidence)     // honest actual state
    return report(status: DONE, proof: { check, evidence.output, evidence.exit })   // CMP-2 — claim names its check
```

The claim is never made before the gate; the gate's evidence *is* the claim's warrant.

### 4.2 Delegated completion (CMP-3)

```text
[REFERENCE]
accept_delegated(subordinate_report, task):
    // the report's "success" is INPUT, not evidence
    artifact := observe(task)          // the diff / output / run result the subordinate did NOT author
    if artifact is absent:
        return UNVERIFIED("subordinate reported success but produced no observable artifact")  // TR-4 kinship
    return claim_complete(artifact, task.done_criteria)   // verify the artifact, then (only then) roll up
// an orchestrator relays a completion only after this returns DONE — never on the strength
// of the subordinate's word (ORC-5 summarizes upward; CMP-3 makes the summary's success earned)
```

### 4.3 Proxy checks that do not prove the claim (CMP-4)

| Claim | Proves it | Does NOT prove it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Build compiles | build exit 0 | linter clean |
| Tests pass | test run: 0 failures | build succeeds, "should pass" |
| Bug fixed | original symptom reproduced → now passes | code changed, looks right |
| Regression test works | red→green verified (fails before fix, passes after) | test passes once |
| Requirements met | each requirement checked line-by-line | suite green |
| Delegated task done | the subordinate's observable artifact verified | the subordinate's "success" report |

### 4.4 Relationship to the honesty family

| Spec | Grounds a claim about… | Evidence it demands |
| --- | --- | --- |
| l1-claim-verification | a *fact* | a cited source span (CV-4) |
| l1-tool-receipts | an *action* happened + its result | a keyed runtime receipt (TR-3/TR-4) |
| **this spec** | *work is complete / passing* | a fresh run of the authoritative check (CMP-1) |

The three are one discipline — *no assertion without its proper evidence* — applied to
the three things an agent asserts: what is true, what it did, and what it finished.

## nodus-relevance mapping

A workflow already produces a grounded outcome — a `RunResult` with a typed status
(`Completed` / `Failed`), per-step results, and typed error codes (`@err:`, `!!`
invariants, the error taxonomy) — so the workflow layer is *well-positioned*, not
deficient. CMP is a **host-side consumption discipline** over that outcome and needs
**no new language invariant** (LP-1/LP-2):

| Element | nodus seam | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fresh evidence (CMP-1) | the `RunResult` of the actual run | The host reads the real terminal status + step outcomes; it never narrates a success the `RunResult` does not show. |
| The claim names its check (CMP-2) | `AuditProvider` run trace (HO-*) | The proving evidence is the recorded run; a completion cites its `RunResult`, not a bare "it worked." |
| Delegated success verified (CMP-3) | a sub-workflow's `RunResult` is the observable artifact | An orchestrating host verifies the sub-run's status, never a narrated claim about it. |
| Right check not a proxy (CMP-4) | `!!` invariants + `@test:` blocks assert the actual claim | A step's own invariants/tests are the authoritative check; a green lint is not a passing run. |

nodus's contribution stays *produce a truthful `RunResult`*; the host must then *not lie
about it*. A host that already trusts the `RunResult` behaves exactly as intended — so the
mapping is additive and warrants no new NL invariant.

## 5. Drawbacks & Alternatives

- **Verification costs a round-trip.** Running the real check before every completion claim adds latency. Accepted: a false "done" costs far more (a crash, a shipped gap, lost trust and rework), and CMP-1 only demands the check that *already* defines done — it adds honesty, not new gates.
- **Some claims have no runnable check.** A genuinely un-checkable completion (a subjective judgment) cannot be mechanically verified. CMP-2/CMP-5 handle this honestly: it is surfaced as *unverified*, never dressed as done — the same fail-visible posture as OI-8.
- **Alternative — trust the actor (self or delegated).** Rejected: an actor's own report is the least reliable evidence of its success, and the delegation case (relaying a sub-agent's "success" unread) is exactly where false completions hide (CMP-3).
- **Alternative — fold into `l1-quality-standards`.** Rejected: quality-standards defines *which gates* make work done; it does not govern the *behavioral honesty* of not claiming a gate green without running it, nor the cross-actor rule that a delegated success is verified independently. Those are a distinct contract — the completion member of the grounding family, sibling to claim-verification and tool-receipts, not a definition-of-done detail.
- **Alternative — fold into `l1-claim-verification`.** Rejected: that spec grounds *factual* claims against *sources*; a completion claim has no source, it has a *check*, and its delegated-verification rule (CMP-3) has no analogue in source-grounding. Same family, different evidence.

| 1.1.0 | 2026-07-23 | Core Team | Added CMP-6 — a probabilistic outcome estimate is **not evidence in either direction**: however well calibrated, it may never satisfy, replace, weaken, shorten, or waive a check CMP-1…CMP-5 require, and a check's absence is never excused by a high estimate. Composition is one-way — evidence decides *whether the work is done*, an estimate decides *how hard to look and whom to involve* — so a low estimate may demand more checking than the minimum while a high one may never demand less. The converse is also closed: a passing check does not license suppressing a low estimate from the record or the hand-off, because the estimate's value is precisely in flagging the gaps no check was written for.

| 1.0.0 | 2026-07-15 | Core Team | Initial spec — completion verification as the work-state member of the grounding/honesty family (beside claim-verification for facts and tool-receipts for actions): fresh same-turn evidence from the authoritative check before any complete/passing/fixed/succeeded claim, actual-state reported otherwise (CMP-1); the claim names its check — command + output + exit/failure count, reconstructable/falsifiable, unrunnable ⇒ unverified not asserted (CMP-2); delegated success verified independently against an observable artifact the subordinate did not author its report of, never relayed on the subordinate's word (CMP-3); the check proves the claim not a weaker proxy — linter≠build, build≠tests, one-pass≠regression-fixed (red-green), green-suite≠requirements-met (checked line-by-line) (CMP-4); no surface presents work as done on an unverified assumption or relayed self-report, unverified is labeled not rendered as done (CMP-5); §4.1 completion gate, §4.2 delegated completion, §4.3 proxy-check table, §4.4 honesty-family relationship; nodus-relevance mapping needing no new NL invariant — the RunResult/@err/!!/@test seams already ground outcomes, CMP is the host-side "don't lie about the RunResult" consumption discipline. Distilled from an adoption pass over an external agent-methodology reference whose brainstorm→spec→plan→subagent-execution pipeline, TDD/YAGNI/DRY gates, and systematic-debugging root-cause discipline were already realized by the magic SDD engine + l1-development-workflow + l1-quality-standards + l1-deliberation/lookahead + l1-orchestration recovery ladders — CMP captures the one unowned delta: the verify-before-claiming-done + verify-delegated-success honesty contract that sat in the gap between claim-verification (facts) and tool-receipts (actions). |
