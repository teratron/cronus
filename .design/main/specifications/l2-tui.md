# TUI Frontend

**Version:** 1.2.0
**Status:** Stable
**Layer:** implementation
**Implements:** l1-architecture.md

## Overview

Architectural layer 3: the **terminal user-interface frontend**. It renders core state interactively in the terminal (boards, status, sessions, agent activity) and accepts slash-style commands with parity to the CLI and application surfaces.

Its slash catalog is not declared here. It is a **projection of the core's invocable registry** — the same catalog the CLI and the desktop shell project — so the three surfaces share one vocabulary by construction rather than by maintenance.

## 1. Motivation

The TUI gives an interactive, keyboard-driven view of the autonomous office without a graphical environment — ideal over SSH and on servers/hubs. It surfaces live state (Kanban, agent activity, logs) that the plain CLI cannot render well.

`[ADDED v1.1.0]` This frontend is also where the project learned what a mirrored catalog costs. Its parity was asserted against a hand-copied list of the CLI's verbs, held inside this crate specifically so the check would not need a dependency on the crate it was checking. The reasoning was sound; the result was an oracle comparing a copy against itself. The CLI grew to twenty-nine groups, the copy stayed at twenty-one, and the assertion remained green while the two surfaces diverged by eight verbs. The amendment replaces the copy with a projection and the self-comparison with a corpus.

## 2. Constraints & Assumptions

- Implemented in **Rust**, linking the core crate; runs in any ANSI terminal.
- Event-driven render loop reflecting core state changes; never blocks on long core operations (async).
- Slash-command input mirrors the CLI command set (INV-3 parity).
- No domain logic in the TUI layer (INV-2).
- **The slash catalog is generated, not written.** `[ADDED v1.1.0]` It is built from the registry's descriptors, as is the discovery listing. A hand-maintained catalog is forbidden as a source of truth, and a hand-copied restatement of another surface's verbs is forbidden as an oracle.
- **This frontend is reached through the single binary.** `[ADDED v1.1.0]` The terminal UI is a verb of the one entry point rather than a separately named second executable, so a user meets one product with one command surface.
- **Panels render from a core-supplied projection.** `[ADDED v1.1.0]` Board, office, and session views are read models the core provides. A panel that has no projection renders as *unavailable*, never as empty — the two are different states and must remain distinguishable.

## 3. Invariant Compliance (Layer 2 only)

| L1 Invariant | Implementation |
| --- | --- |
| INV-1 Embeddable core | TUI links the core library; pure consumer. |
| INV-2 Logic in core only | TUI handles rendering + key/command input; behavior delegates to the core. `[MODIFIED v1.1.0]` Domain facts the panels need — locations, orderings, defaults, board contents — arrive as core projections; the frontend derives none of them. |
| INV-3 Command parity | `[MODIFIED v1.1.0]` Parity is **structural, not asserted**. The slash catalog is a projection of the invocable registry shared with the CLI and desktop shell, leaving no place to hold a verb the registry lacks and no way to miss one it has. The prior hand-copied verb mirror is deleted and tombstoned (finding F-2). Residual behavioral agreement is proven by the conformance corpus, which this frontend registers against from its own test target (SP-6/SP-7). |
| INV-4 Hub-and-spoke autonomy | Runs on a hub (incl. over SSH) to observe/drive the autonomous engine; on a spoke acts as a client view. |
| INV-5 Durable, restartable state | TUI holds only view state; reconnecting reflects the core's durable state. |
| INV-6 Graceful capability scaling | Panels for unsupported capabilities are hidden/disabled, never behaviorally divergent. `[MODIFIED v1.1.0]` *Unsupported* and *empty* are distinct rendered states; a panel whose projection is unavailable says so rather than displaying empty columns. |
| INV-7 Security of client data | `[MODIFIED v1.1.0]` Secrets are never rendered. Masking is applied by the **dispatch boundary** rather than re-implemented here; this frontend's local redaction call is removed in favor of the shared one, and the separate obligation that the core supply a non-empty secret list is tracked as a residual in `l2-surface-conformance` §4.7. |
| INV-8 Single-deployable modular monolith | The TUI is a frontend over the sanctioned frontend↔core boundary: it renders one in-process core, or attaches to a hub as a client view — never a distributed tier. It introduces no service and no orchestration dependency; its interaction with the core is an in-process contract/event stream. |
| INV-9 Shipped-surface honesty | `[MODIFIED v1.1.0]` Enforced at the projection. Only shipped invocables enter the catalog and the discovery listing, so an unbound slash verb is unrepresentable rather than discouraged — which also retires the placeholder response this frontend returned for every verb but one. Retirement follows the same declared path as the CLI (l1-architecture v1.4.0). |
| INV-10 Representation isolation at the inward seam | The inward seam INV-10 governs lives inside the core; the TUI stands outward and binds core contract types only, naming no adapter representation (no store row, no keychain handle). Per `l2-crate-topology` §4.8 the TUI may even link the pure-domain tier and still touches no storage or keychain type — the inward leak INV-10 forbids is structurally absent from this surface. |

## 4. Detailed Design

### 4.1 Views

| View | Content |
| --- | --- |
| Board | Kanban columns `triage → todo → ready → running → blocked → done → archive` with live task movement |
| Office | Graphical-in-text schema of agents and their current tasks |
| Status | Current position, progress, blockers (mirrors `status` capability) |
| Sessions/Log | Live agent activity, decisions, and tool output stream |
| Command bar | Slash-command input with discovery, rendered from the catalog `[MODIFIED v1.1.0]` |

`[ADDED v1.1.0]` Each panel is a pure function of a core-supplied projection plus terminal-local view state. Until a projection exists for a panel, that panel renders **unavailable with its reason** — the state it must not do is render an empty, successful-looking view of data it could not obtain, which is the panel-level form of the same defect the CLI exhibits when a store error prints an empty listing.

### 4.2 Render loop

    MASK --> STATE
```

### 4.3 Parity with CLI

`[MODIFIED v1.1.0]` **This section deliberately restates no command set.**

Both frontends project the same registry, so a slash verb and its shell counterpart are two renderings of one descriptor. The difference is presentation — interactive panels versus text output, and slash form versus verb-first flags — never behavior, and never membership (INV-3).

What remains checkable after derivation is behavioral agreement between two projections of the same descriptor: a rejection surfaced by one and swallowed by the other, or an unavailable projection that one distinguishes from empty and the other does not. That class is proven by the conformance corpus, which this frontend drives through its **real** projection from its own test target — not through a restatement of it, which is precisely what the deleted mirror was.

`[ADDED v1.2.0]` **The two surfaces do not project the same loci, and that is not a parity failure.** This frontend projects `Semantic` + `ClientLocal`; the command line projects `Semantic` + `Installation`. The shared `Semantic` set is where INV-3 parity is required and proven. The differing halves are *declared* differences, not omissions: an installation verb has no meaning inside a live session, and a pane-focus action has none as a one-shot process. This is SP-8 applied to the surface boundary — the difference is named with its reason rather than tolerated, so the next reader neither unifies it wrongly nor reads it as licence for the next divergence.

`[ADDED v1.2.0]` **A slash-like line that names no invocable is not an error.** Resolution answers `Unknown` separately from any outcome (SP-13), and this frontend's response to it is to treat the line as **ordinary input** rather than to render a failure. Folding that answer into a failure outcome would make every message beginning with a slash-shaped token an error — which is wrong for a surface whose primary input is free text. The command line, projecting the same registry, answers the identical resolution with a usage error, because for a one-shot invocation there is nothing to fall through to. One resolution result, two correct and opposite renderings; a single merged outcome could not have produced both.

### 4.4 Entry point

`[ADDED v1.1.0]` The terminal UI is launched as a verb of the single `cronus` binary. A separately named executable presents the same engine as two products, splits discovery (`--help` would not mention it), and gives a user two things to install and remember for one capability. The binary that previously shipped standalone is retired under the declared-retirement rule rather than deleted silently.

`[ADDED v1.2.0]` It is additionally the **default composition** (LH-4): `cronus` with no verb brings up this frontend, and `cronus tui` names it explicitly. Both spellings are required. The default is what lets a user meet the product by typing its name; the explicit verb is what lets a script, a test, or a desktop shortcut state what it wants, so that its meaning does not change on the day the default does.

`[ADDED v1.2.0]` **This frontend's own actions are registry entries, not a private table.** Pane focus, panel toggles, and every other action that exists only here register as `ClientLocal` invocables through the same door a core or contributed verb uses. Keeping them in a local table beside the projection would rebuild, at a smaller scale, exactly the hand-maintained catalog v1.1.0 deleted — and the second such table is where the verb no other surface ever learns about will live.

## 5. Drawbacks & Alternatives

- **Terminal rendering limits:** complex office visualizations are richer in the graphical app (INV-6 allows the subset).
- **A generated catalog gives up compile-time exhaustiveness** over the verb set. `[ADDED v1.1.0]` Accepted for the same forced reason as the CLI: a build-time catalog cannot carry a contributed verb.
- **Alternative — TUI only, no GUI:** rejected; non-technical clients need the full graphical surface (layer 4).
- **Alternative — regenerate the mirrored verb list instead of deleting it:** `[ADDED v1.1.0]` rejected. A generated copy is still a copy; it fails as a stale artifact rather than as a disagreement between the things that actually run, which is the failure the corpus must produce.

## Document History

| Version | Date | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.2.0 | 2026-09-06 | Surface-boundary amendment. §4.3 states that this frontend and the command line project **different locus sets** (`Semantic`+`ClientLocal` here, `Semantic`+`Installation` there) and that the difference is a declared one rather than a parity failure — the shared semantic set is where INV-3 binds, and the differing halves are named with their reason per SP-8. §4.3 also fixes the response to an unresolved slash line: resolution answers `Unknown` separately from any outcome (SP-13), and this surface treats it as **ordinary input**, where the command line treats the identical answer as a usage error — one resolution result, two correct opposite renderings, which a single merged failure outcome could not have produced. §4.4 adds that this is the **default composition** reached by a bare invocation and also addressable as `cronus tui` (LH-4), and that this frontend's own pane and panel actions register as `ClientLocal` invocables through the shared door rather than living in a private table — the smaller rebuild of exactly the catalog v1.1.0 deleted. |
| 1.0.1 | 2026-07-29 | Extended §3 Invariant-Compliance to INV-8/9/10 (frontend boundary; honest slash-command surface; binds contract types only) — completeness fix. |
| 1.1.0 | 2026-09-05 | The slash catalog becomes a **projection of the invocable registry** rather than a hand-maintained list, and the **hand-copied verb mirror is deleted and tombstoned** (finding F-2) — the check-that-cannot-fail this frontend carried, green while the two surfaces differed by eight verbs. INV-3 parity is restated as structural, with residual behavioral agreement proven by the conformance corpus driven through this surface's **real** projection from its own test target. INV-9 moves to representability: only shipped invocables enter the catalog, retiring the placeholder response returned for every verb but one. INV-7 masking moves to the dispatch boundary and the local redaction call is removed; the inert-empty-secret-list half is recorded as a residual. INV-6 gains the *unsupported ≠ empty* distinction, and §4.1 makes it explicit for panels: a view whose projection is unavailable says so rather than rendering empty columns — the panel-level form of the defect the sibling frontend shows when a store error prints an empty listing. Adds §4.4: the terminal UI becomes a **verb of the single binary** rather than a separately named executable, with the standalone binary retired under the declared-retirement rule. |
